Theme: Professional_139 AKA Professional
========================================
Major thanks to Matt Jones at http://geeksta.com for his work on the
XSilver theme for the Geeklog.net CMSystem. I really enjoy modifying
XSilver and this theme "Professional_139" is proof of that. Thanks
goes to Squatty at http://squatty.com for his support and the entire
Geeklog.net staff.

IMPORTANT
=========
This theme doesn't provide page menu elements. Basically I never liked the
idea of having navigational elements spread about on a page. It not only
contributes to poor design but it definitely aids in confusing a user. To
address this problem and give users the power of Page menu elements I am
enclosing code in which was provided to me by Dirk from http://geeklog.net

========================================
function phpblock_plugin_menu()
{
    $retval = '';
    $plugin_menu = PLG_getMenuItems();
    for( $i = 1; $i <= count($plugin_menu); $i++ )
    {
        $url = current($plugin_menu);
        $plg = key($plugin_menu);
        $retval .= '<a href="' . $url . '">' . $plg . '</a><br>';
        next( $plugin_menu );
    }
    return $retval;
}
========================================

The above code will give you back your page menu elements but this time
it'll go into a block instead of being found within the header as a third
navigational element.

To apply the above code, simply copy the code between the seperators above
and open the following file for Geeklog: geeklog\system\lib-custom.php

Scroll to the bottom of the file and paste it directly above ?>. Go into
Geeklog and create a new block. You can call the block anything you want
but it is the Block Function field you need to pay attention too. please 
paste the following into block Function: phpblock_plugin_menu .

Now I know you didn't paste the period so choose Block Type: PHP Block.
Save and exit the block editor and check out your new block :)

Tip: you might wish to position the block directly above or beneath your
other navigational elements so keep your users focused than confused.

README
======
   There are a few things about this theme which you should be aware
   of.

   1. This has a new block which isn't really a block. It is
   hard-coded. When a user is logged-out, they'll see the regular
   login block + register fields directly beneath it.

     1. Two links within this hard-coded block. One points to forgot
     password whereas the other for register points to a privacy
     policy. This will most likely not make it into the final build. I
     currently have it implemented for myself.

   2. All links have been underlined and retain the original web
   standard link colors. Links change color when visited, hovered over
   and active. This has been done so to comply with some web
   standards.

   3. Unlike most themes, you can hold control and scroll with your
   mouses wheel (if you have one), and the text will change size. This
   has also been done so to comply with some web standards. Otherwise
   you can increase or decrease size through your browser.

   4. One look at the stylesheet and you'll see something so sweet.
   Mostly all tags have been alphabetized and renamed so to make
   editing any thing much easier. This required some changes
   throughout the entire theme but was well worth it.

   5. Incredibly the theme is based around 5 colors and that's it.
   This has been done so colorize a theme on a global scale in seconds
   rather than minutes. Trust me, this is the easiest theme ever to
   color!

   #F7F7F7 is the color of the left block background.
   #E7E7E7 is the color of the right block background.
   #CCCCCC colors borders which need to be darker than #E7E7E7.
   #1A3955 is the color of block titles, header and footer background.
   #000000 (black) is the color of text.
   #FFFFFF (white) is the color of most backgrounds.

   To be honest, the entire theme revolves around the above colors. In
   theory this has been done so to easily color it. All other colors
   found within the sytlesheet should not be touched. In theory, this
   is how you would most likely change the color in a global swoop...

   Pretend you wanted a green theme...

   #F7F7F7 is your lightest green.
   #E7E7E7 is a bit darker than #F7F7F7.
   #CCCCCC is a bit more darker than #E7E7E7.
   #1A3955 (block titles) have to contrast well against your greens.
   #000000 (black) is the color of text (should be left alone).
   #FFFFFF (white) is the color of most backgrounds (should be left alone).

   Don't play with any other colors and do not remove the link
   underlines and I would be more than happy to accept your stylesheet
   if you would like to share it with others.

      If you must change the link colors which is acceptable as long
      as it definitely compliements the theme is cool *but* please do
      not remove the underlined links. Some people are colorblind and
      though underlines might not appeal to some I simply prefer
      leaving them in this theme for more reasons than colorblindness.

   6. The new Geeklog 1.3.9 automatically contains the required code
   within the index.php file so to achieve the Splash Block.
   Basically, if a certain template exist within the themes root
   (topcenterblock-span.thtml) and a static page is made to appear on
   the homepage above everything else, the block will span across the
   center and right side blocks. To remove this feature, simply remove
   the topcenterblock-span.thtml file.

   7. If you wish to use other themes along with this theme, here a
   few things which you'll need to know.

      7a. Do not disable your login block to Guest (User Functions).
      7b. Add a login link to the header of your other themes if you
          wish to remove the User Functions block for Guest.
      7c. Notice anything necessary not mentioned here, notify me.

   8. One thing which I use to not pay much attention to before but am
   a bit proud of lately is the calendar on this mod. The month is
   certainly impressive and so is the week view. The day is a little
   itchy but it fits. I really hope the calendar looks cool!

   9. The search function is hardcoded into the left block of the
   theme. This has been done as I've always liked it like that :)

   Thats it. I will not work on any other themes except for this one
   and for quite some time. It should be fully compatible with Geeklog
   1.3.9.
