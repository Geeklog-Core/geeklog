<h1>Advanced Search</h1>

<div id="content">
    <p>Advanced search will allow you to query the entire database of articles, 
    comments, posts and other pages to find what your looking for. When 
    conducting a query, at least one field must be selected. The query fields 
    are:</p>
    
    <table border="1" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <th style="width:8%">Field</th>
        <th>Required</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Key Words</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>These are the key words you wish to search for, an example would be
            "Free" or "Fun" (without the quotes).<br /><br />
            From the drop-down menu, you can select if search results should contain        
            the exact phrase (exactly as you entered it), all of the words, or any
            of the words.<br /><br />
            Wildcards may also be used here. A "%" can substitute for zero or more 
            characters while a "_" can subsitute a single character.  
            </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Titles Only</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Check this box if you only want to search item titles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Date</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Date range to search on. Enter the start date and end date for your
            search</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Topic</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Select the topic you wish to search on from the drop-down list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Type</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Select the type of the search. Your options are "All", which searches
            through all the searchable content of the site, or you can restrict your
            search to only one of "Stories", "Comments" as well as other content 
            available on this site.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Authors</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Select the author you wish to search on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Results</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
        <td>Select the number of search results you want to see per page</td>
    </tr>
