<h1>Advanced Search</h1>

<p>Advanced search will allow you to query the entire database of stories and
comments to find what your looking for. When conducting a query, at least one
field must be selected. The query fields are:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">
<tr>
    <th style="width:8%">Field</th>
    <th>Required</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Key Words</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>These are the key words you wish to search for, an example would be
        "Free" or "Fun" (without the quotes).<br>
        From the drop-down menu, you can select if search results should contain        the exact phrase (exactly as you entered it), all of the words, or any
        of the words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Titles Only</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>Check this box if you only want to search item titles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Date</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>Date range to search on. Enter the start date and end date for your
        search</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Topic</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>Select the topic you wish to search on from the drop-down list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>Select the type of the search. Your options are "All", which searches
        through all the searchable content of the site, or you can restrict your
        search to only one of "Stories", "Comments" as well as one
        of the installed plugins (e.g. "Static Pages").</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Authors</td>
    <td style="text-align:center;">No</td>
    <td>Select the author you wish to search on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Results</td>

    <td>Select the number of search results you want to see per page</td>
</tr>
