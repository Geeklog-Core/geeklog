# This script will make your pre1.2 Geeklog distribution compatible with 
# MySQL 3.23.X.  You MUST make sure you have already upgraded your database to
# GL 1.2 first (i.e. no gaurantees are made if this scripts is ran against any
# geeklog install other than 1.2).  New users installing Geeklog for the first 
# time do not need to run this script.
#
# PLEASE be sure to BACK UP YOUR DATABASE before running this script.  You can
# do this by issuing the following command:
# >mysqldump -u[username] -p[password] [database name] > geeklog_backup.sql
#
# This will save your table structure and data to a file called geeklog_backup.sql
# If you have problems with this script you should drop your geeklog database
# and restore it from that file.
#
# PLEASE take the time to view the code in this script so you understand what is
# going on.  You've been warned.

# The flow for this is fairly simple.  First, check to see which user is 
# assigned the user id of 1.  If it is someone other than anonymous, change that
# users ID to the next available user id (for our example let's say it is 4).  Then
# we need to update all comments, articles, etc tied to that users old id to the 
# new ID of 4.  Then we need to figure out what user id anonymous is now (we won't
# assume it is -1 but it should be).  We then update the anonymous users old ID of
# -1 (or whatever it is) to be 1.  Then we update the anonymous users article,
# comments, etc to use the new id of 1.
