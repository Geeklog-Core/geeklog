<h2>
<a NAME="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
GeekLog was developed for the Security Geeks web site and has been released
under the GNU GPL for use by others.&nbsp; Configuring GeekLog is meant
to be an easy process though it will require you to have access to several
components of your system.
<p>This document is still evolving, so there may be unintended omissions
or various steps may be over or under explained. It's assumed that you
have some working experience with some form of&nbsp; Apache, SQL databases,
and PHP.
<h2>
<a NAME="customization"></a>Customization</h2>
Customizing GeekLog is fairly easy, but not automated...&nbsp; Yet...&nbsp;
My suggestion when working with customizing GeekLog is to take it slow,
make one change at a time and always backup your your work!
<p>There are three main files to customize the look of Geeklog:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#000000">
<td><font color="#FFFFFF">File&nbsp;</font></td>

<td><font color="#FFFFFF">Description</font></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>public_html/layout/style.css</td>

<td>Here you can change font's, colors, borders or anything that CSS can
do.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>public_html/layout/header.inc</td>

<td>This is the header that formats the layout for the page.&nbsp; Be careful
in here as there are some PHP calls as well, but this is the base HTML
layout for the site.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>public_html/layout/footer.inc</td>

<td>This is the corresponding footer to the header file.&nbsp; Be careful
in here as well.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Additionally some HTML has been moved in to layout blocks which you
can edit though the user interface.&nbsp; Right now this is limited to
the block functions (<i>blockheader</i> and <i>blockfooter</i>) but customizing
this will go a long way to making your site look unique!
<p>Certain tags are supported in the layout blocks, these are:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr BGCOLOR="#000000">
<td><font color="#FFFFFF">Row</font></td>

<td><font color="#FFFFFF">Description</font></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%title</td>

<td>Will print the title for the block that is supplied when the block
is called.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%help</td>

<td>Will print a ? and link to a help file for this block.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a NAME="support"></a>Support</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Bug reports</b> - Submit bug reports at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=7371">SourceForge</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Mailing lists</b> - Join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7371">mailing
list</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Patches</b> - Please submit patches at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=7371">SourceForge</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>General Help</b> - A better place for general "I can't do it!" help
is the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7371">mailing list</a>.
Stuff that may be of more general interest is welcome here; but you will
probably get better help on the lists.</li>

<li>
<b>Link submissions</b> - Use the <a href="http://www.geeklog.org/submit.php?type=link">contribute
link</a> link to tell us about your new site running GeekLog.</li>

<li>
<b>Story submissions</b> - Use the <a href="http://www.geeklog.org/submit.php?type=story">contribute
news</a> link to tell us your ideas for the GeekLog site and questions.
DO NOT use this for bug reports. Use SourceForge for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=7371">bug
reports</a>. Also try not to use it for general "I can't do this!" help;
you'll get a much better response for those on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7371">mailing
list</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Feature requests</b> - Where to send feature requests depends a bit
on what the request is. In general, the mailing list is a decent place,
and if it is something significant, you may want to send it in as a story
submission. You may also want to go over to SourceForge and submit it as
a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=7371">bug
report</a> (make sure you select "Feature Request" for the "Group"), so
we can have it filed and we can track it easily.</li>
