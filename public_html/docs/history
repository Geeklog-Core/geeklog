GeekLog History/Changes:

(1.3.8)
-------

- You can now make one topic the default topic. The topic selection in the
  story submission form will then default to this topic.
- When clicking on the "contribute" link from the topic index page, the new
  story will now default to the topic you just viewed.
  This only works with themes that use the {menu_elements} variable in
  header.thtml. Other themes can use the new variable {current_topic} which
  holds '&topic=<topicid>' when a topic is selected (and is empty otherwise).
- Integrated Vincent Furia's improvements for COM_exportRDF. You can now use
  $_CONF['rdf_limit'] to limit the number of stories in the RDF file by
  setting this to a number (e.g. 10) or a number of hours (e.g. 24h).
  $_CONF['rdf_storytext'] lets you add the story's introtext to the RDF feed.
  Also fixed a bug with un-escaped special characters in the feed's title.
- A Static Page with a title of "topic:<topic-id>" (e.g. topic:GeekLog) will
  be displayed on top of the index page for that topic (based on a hack by
  James Fryer).
- Added paging to the list of Static Pages (for more than 50 pages).
- Fixed problem with the Older Stories block disappearing when it was edited
  (e.g. moved from left to right), bug #670673.
- Fixed "late" update of portal blocks (bug #681855).
- You can now "clone" static pages, i.e. make a copy of an existing page.
- You can now edit the ID of a static page to create more readable URLs like
  http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=about
- Integrated Tom Willet's version of the Static Pages plugin. This new version
  is now called Static Pages 1.3.
  Use Geeklog's install script to upgrade from any previous version (1.1 or 1.2)
- Fixed a typo in lib-sessions.php that caused the creation of unnecessary
  sessions (pointed out by Kobaz).
- Fixed malformed cookie (used $_CONF['site_url'] instead of
  $_CONF['cookiedomain']), found & fixed by Jon Evans.
- Fixed mixing of comments from different plugins, found & fixed by Alan McKay.
- A theme can provide its own functions to render the site header and footer
  (this is not a new feature). Geeklog now expects those functions to be named
  <themename>_siteHeader and <themename>_siteFoote, respectively. Until now,
  it was, however, looking for the wrong function names ...
- Added the piece of code that is needed to make the Theme Tester work to
  lib-common.php (won't do anything without the Theme Tester block).
- Fixed SQL query for displaying new comments in the What's New block, provided
  by Marc Von Ahn (with some help from Rob Griffiths).
- Changes to make Geeklog install and work again on old version of MySQL
  (e.g. MySQL 3.22). Special thanks to Markus Guske for providing the fixes
  for the What's New block and for testing the new install.
- Feb 13/03: (Blaine) Added new Plugin function to support Center Blocks 
  Included call to PLG_showCenterblock in index.php
- The user's signature is now appended to messages sent to another user.
- Feb 6/03: (Blaine)  Added support for custom user registration and account
  profile: Added hooks to users.php, usersettings.php  and admin/user.php and
  new $_CONF parm to enable
  Developer is responsible for code to handle new form processing, account
  record save, update and delete.
- The list of blocks now includes a column indicating whether the block is
  enabled or disabled (will need changes in admin/block/listblocks.thtml and
  listitem.thtml template files of custom themes).
- Fixed problem in the Admin editors for blocks, events, links, polls, stories,
  and topics, that would result in an "Access Denied" message under certain
  circumstances.
- Variable {rdf_url} (available in footer.thtml) holds the URL of the RDF file.
- What's Related block is now created dynamically.
- Top Ten Commented Stories didn't count comments on stories submitted by
  anonymous users (found & fixed by Laurence Whitworth).
- Allow users to change their username if $_CONF['allow_username_change'] is
  set to 1.
- Jan 18/03: (Blaine) Corrected problem in mysql.class.php where the checks in
  dbdelete, dbchange, dbcount and dbcopy for a passed value of 0 were not
  sufficient. If the parameter was 0 - it was assuming it was empty.
  Consequence: The dbdelete would delete all records or dbcount would return
  count(*) 
- Display Preferences and Comment Preferences have been merged. There is now
  only one option, Preferences, in the User Functions block.
- Hard-coded HTML for the Display Preferences, Comment Preferences, and
  Account information has been moved to template files (new "preferences"
  directory).

- Updated French language file, provided by Jaques.
- Updated Hellenic (Greek) language file, provided by Access-=-Denied Networks
- Updated Spanish and Spanish (Argentina) language files,
  provided by Fernando Bernardini
- New Slovenian language file, provided by gape
- New Slovak language file, provided by Rado
- New Romanian language file, provided by Dan Gheorghitza
- New Chinese language file (gb2312 encoding), provided by Crocodile King
- New Czech language file, provided by Hermes Trismegistos


January 13, 2003 (1.3.7sr1)
----------------

Security issues:

1. Javascript code could be used in the homepage link of a user's profile
   (reported by Jin Yean Tan).
2. Javascript code could be injected in several URLs so that these could then
   be used for a cross-site scripting attack (reported by Jin Yean Tan).
3. Anybody could delete comments, provided they knew the comment id.
4. A StoryAdmin could manipulate any story, even if permissions should have
   prevented that. The same applied to Admins for links, events, polls, topics,
   and blocks (reported by Kobaz).

- The new user notification email was always sent out, even if 'user' was not
  listed in $_CONF['notification'].
- In admin/database.php, added a check to test if function is_executable() is
  available (since it is not available on Windows).
- {copyright_notice} in the site's footer (footer.thtml) will now use the
  current year for the copyright notice. You can override this by setting
  $_CONF['copyrightyear'] to the year you want.
  Also, new variables {lang_copyright} and {current_year} as well as {site_name}
  and {site_slogan} are now available in footer.thtml so that you can build a
  customised copyright notice from them.
- Fixed incomplete links to search results from poll comments.
- Fixed wrong link to the week view from the last week of the month view.
- Fixed bug where links was not using the date field - being stored as null.
- Fixed image resizing when using ImageMagick.
- Added the actual and max. image dimensions in the error message that is
  displayed when an image exceeds the max. image dimensions and no imagelib
  is configured.
- The Admin menu will now be displayed for users which have Admin access to
  a plugin but not to a core Geeklog Admin feature.
- The redirect in index.php (when a site is called up with a URL other than
  the one configured in $_CONF['site_url']) now checks for the existence of
  $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_HOST']. Also, the server name comparison is done
  case-insensitive now.
- New config option $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault']: Set to 1 if new users
  should be subscribed to the daily digest automatically. Defaults to 0 (no
  automatic subscribtion), thus restoring the behaviour of Geeklog prior to
  1.3.7.
- Removed some unused / outdated files (include and etc directories)
- Updated URLs to point to www.geeklog.net and lists.geeklog.net instead of the
  now outdated places on Sourceforge.
- Updated Dutch language file, provided by R.F. van der Veen
- New Danish language files (for Geeklog and for the Static Pages plugin),
  provided by Steen Broelling


December 16, 2002 (1.3.7)
-----------------

- In all Admin editors, the hard-coded default group permissions have been
  changed from 3 (read/write) to 2 (read-only).
- Make sure an error message is displayed when a StoryAdmin tries to edit a
  story s/he does not have access to.
- Hide topics from the Admin's list of stories that the current (Story)Admin
  has no access to.
- Tom Willet found a problem in admin/user.php that sometimes mangled user
  names, especially on sites hosted on sourceforge.net.
- Fixed an SQL error when using single quotes in a block title.
- When updating events in the master calendar, make sure copies of such events
  in the personal calendars are updated as well (including deleting them when
  the original event is removed from the master calendar).
- Fixed PRIMARY KEY for table personal_events, so that more than one user can
  add an event to his/her personal calendar.

- New Hellenic (Greek) language file, provided by Access-=-Denied Networks
- New Spanish language file, provided by LeChuck
- Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik
- Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65
- Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata


December 3, 2002 (1.3.7rc1)
----------------

- Modifed savesubmission() to better handle Plugin return - Bug ID 642106
- Modified Comment Plugin API Comment call - PLG_handlePluginComment now passes
  $operation to indicate a 'save' or 'delete'.
- Fixed problems with the portal.php redirect for links (bug #579221).
- Fixed a problem when uploading images with certain versions of Opera.
- When deleting a topic, also remove stories for that topic from the submission
  queue.
- Added a redirect in index.php when the site was called up with the "wrong"
  URL (i.e. not the one that has been set in $_CONF['site_url']), thus
  fixing the "www vs. non-www" problem where people showed up in Who's Online
  but did not get the User Functions block.
- The topic selection in the daily digest now defaults to "on" for all topics,
  i.e. when the daily digest is activated ($_CONF['emailstories'] = 1) and
  a user has not selected any topics yet, s/he will receive a digest for all
  topics. This ensures that new topics are automatically added to the daily
  digest (bug #573305).
- Fixed a permission problem with the daily digest where users could get a
  digested version of a story they didn't have access to.
- Fixed permission problems in the statistics where story titles, links, and
  events where listed even when the current user did not have access to them.
- Added the Top Ten Links to the links page (only when links are displayed
  per category).
- When sending emails, Geeklog now uses \r\n in the mail headers which should
  resolve problems under Windows.
- Resolved a couple of stripslashes() issues.
- The static pages plugin can now be uninstalled using the "delete" option
  from the plugin editor. Note that this will only remove the plugin's tables
  and data from the database, not remove any files.
- Added a simple email notification when a new story, link, or event has been
  submitted or a new user has registered. See $_CONF['notification'] for details
- Added a separate set of config variables for the max. dimensions of user
  photos ($_CONF['max_photo_width'] etc.).
- Fixed a problem when resizing GIF images using the netpbm tools.
- Check the topic permissions when presenting a list of topics in the Admin
  story editor (since the StoryAdmin may not have access to all topics).
- Removed the Normal / Archive / Refreshing drop down menus from the admin
  story and poll editors since they're not used anyway.
- In the links section, do not display link categories when the current user
  does not have access to the links in those categories (bug #612869).
- Fixed problems when using quotes in the title of an HTML-formatted comment
  (including confusing error messages and wrong speed limit alerts).
- Changed the way how Geeklog checks if it's currently displaying the site's
  front page, thus fixing the problem with disappearing "homeonly" blocks.
- Fixed double line spacing in HTML-formatted comments and [code] sections when
  running on PHP 4.2.0 and up.
- Fixed problems with slashes and HTML entities in emails sent out by Geeklog
  (Send story to friend, daily digest, Admin mail utility).
- Added new config variable 'showfirstasfeatured' which, when set to 1, will
  render the first story on _any_ page like it was a featured story.
- Added admin/plugins/newpluginlist.thtml and newlistitem.thml template files
  for the list of plugins not installed yet. These files are optional, i.e.
  the list will be formatted using hard-coded HTML when they don't exist.
- Removed unused template file admin/plugins/installform.thtml.
- The plugin menu will now list all plugins which exist in the file system
  but haven't been installed (yet) with a link to their install script for
  easy installation (based on code provided by Blaine Lang).
- New plugin API function PLG_callCommentForm() and improvements for the use of
  comments in plugins, provided by Blaine Lang.
- The Older Stories block did not take stories into account which were to be
  published in the future. Therefore, the block sometimes listed stories that
  were still on the first index page.
- Added variable {contributedby_photo} (user photo of story author) for use in
  story templates.
- Users couldn't disable display of the Older Stories block in their preferences
- The contents of the Older Stories block was deleted whenever you changed it
  (e.g. moving it from the left to the right column).
- The static pages editor displayed a blank page when the title and/or content
  field of a new static page were not filled in (will display an error message
  now).
- Implemented fixes for plugins using the submission queue, suggested by
  Vincent Furia.
- Following the link "X stories in last 24 hours" from the What's New block
  will now display only the new stories on the index page.
- When $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] = 2, the search is completely blocked
  for anonymous users (1 will only block the advanced search).
- Added a check to test for a valid date format when searching by date.
- Added $_CONF['skip_preview'] to allow submission of comments and stories
  without previewing (defaults to off).
- Search queries with less than 3 characters are now rejected to reduce server
  load.
- (Event)Admins couldn't add events directly to their personal calendar
  (found & fixed by Kenn Osborne).
- Fixed a nasty bug in SEC_inGroup() (in lib-security.php) that let a user
  admin change the password of a root user, so that effectively every user
  admin could become a root user ...
- Topics are now sorted alphabetically by the topic name instead of by topic id.
- Added several new variables which can be used in the story template files.
- New config options $_CONF['dateonly'] and $_CONF['timeonly'] which hold the
  format string for day + month (to be used in the Upcoming Events and Older
  Stories blocks) and the time (to be used for event details).
- Fixed calls to unknown function printErrorMsgs in the file upload class.
- New options in config.php:
  $_CONF['upcomingeventsrange'] = no. of days to look ahead for upcoming events
  $_CONF['emailstoryloginrequired'] = disallow "send story be email" for
  anonymous users
  $_CONF['hideemailicon'], $_CONF['hideprintericon'] = hide email / printer
  icon from stories (and from Story Options block)
  $_CONF['hidenewstories'], $_CONF['hidenewcomments'], $_CONF['hidenewlinks'] =
  hide new stories / comments / links from What's New block
- User photos are now resized according to the image dimensions in config.php
  (if an imagelib is configured - otherwise images exceeding those dimensions
  are rejected).
- Added a check for the proper permissions on the admin page of the Static
  Pages plugin.
- Plugins can now return "false" (or an empty array) from
  plugin_cclabel_<plugin-name> so that the plugin's icon does not show up
  in moderation.php if the user does not have the proper access rights for the
  plugin. Changed the Static Pages plugin to do exactly that.
- Fixed problems when using multiple [code] ... [/code] sections.
- PHP blocks which return an empty string are not displayed any more. This
  allows PHP blocks to "hide" themselves.
- Searching for links caused an SQL error on installs that were upgraded
  from Geeklog 1.1 (missing "date" field in links table). However, links don't
  use that field anyway, so searching by date was removed (the "date" field
  will be added when upgrading the database to 1.3.7).
  Also, the search results are now sorted by link title.
- The calendar displayed an empty last week (in month view) for some months,
  e.g. November 2002.
- COM_pollResults() will not use the side block templates when called from
  pollbooth.php (thus allowing different block layouts for the poll results
  in a side block and in pollbooth.php).
- Allow for theme-based topic icons by using the $_THEME_URL variable as the
  base directory for topic icons (if that variable is set).
- Fixed display (or lack thereof) of $ signs in portal blocks.
- lib-common.php didn't use $_CONF['path_language'] to include the default
  language file.
- What's Related block
  + content is now set for all user submitted stories (previously, links where
    only added in stories submitted by the Admin or user submissions edited by
    the Admin)
  + block is not displayed when it's empty
  + now uses COM_makeList() (i.e. the list.thtml and listitem.thtml template
    files) instead of hard-coded <li> tags
- The What's Related and Story Options blocks can now be used independent of
  each other in the article/article.thtml template file - use {whats_related},
  {story_options} or {whats_related_story_options}.
- Theme authors can now use the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE "hack" for the What's Related
  and Story Options blocks as well (using 'whats_related_block' and
  'story_options_block' as the block names).
- Fixed the "noboxes" feature where all blocks (with the exception of the
  section, login / user functions, and admin blocks) are hidden.
- Changed admin/link/listitem.thtml so that the URLs in the Admin's list of
  links are clickable.
- Fixed an SQL error when calling search.php and there were no stories and no
  comments in the system.
- Fixed an SQL error in the user profile when there were no stories and no polls
  in the system.
- Fixed date bug when previewing stories to be posted around the noon hour in
  the admin story editor.
- Added sanity checks in admin/story.php to prevent possible loss of stories
  when using an incomplete language file (or manipulating the URL).
- Fixed a variable in admin/plugins/editor.ththml of the Smooth Blue theme.
- Fixed a typo and a grammatical error in english.php
- Fixed problems with the "static page as frontpage" hack:
  + will now check if the static pages plugin is installed and enabled
  + uses sp_format (i.e. display blocks as specified in the static pages editor)
  + added a missing stripslashes() call
  New: When you have $_SP_CONF['in_block'] == 1 and the label of the static
  page is neither empty nor "nonews" then that label is used as the block title
  for the static page.
- The "userevent" table is back in lib-database.php. Geeklog doesn't use this
  table any more, but the name is needed when upgrading from old versions.

Localisation:
- New Chinese language file (Big 5 encoding), provided by Jacky Chan
- New Swedish language file, provided by Markus Berg
- Updated Dutch language file, provided by R. F. van der Veen
- Updated French language file, provided by Florent Guiliani
- The German language file now uses the proper national special characters
  (umlauts) instead of HTML entities.

- New Spanish language file for the Static Pages Plugin, provided by gorka


September 20, 2002 (1.3.6)
------------------
- Images in stories can now be resized automatically during upload, provided
  you have either ImageMagick or netpbm installed. See the image settings in
  config.php for details.
- If you create a static page with the title "Frontpage" then the content of
  this static page will be displayed above the first story on the front page
  of your site. If you additionally set the label of this static page to
  "nonews", then the static page will completeley replace the news on the front
  page of your site.
  You may want to wrap static pages in a block - set $_SP_CONF['in_block'] = 1;
  in /path/to/geeklog/plugins/staticpages/config.php
- A user assigned only to the Mail Admin group wasn't able to use the "Mail
  Users" function.
- The filter to disable Javascript onXXX events also changed certain links in
  HTML postings. This should be fixed now.
- The poll uses a POST instead of a GET request now to at least prevent
  primitive manipulation attempts ...
- Events on the same day were displayed in the order they were entered, not
  in the order they were scheduled (occured in day, week, and month view).
- The user function and admin blocks weren't using the proper templates when
  the theme was using the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE trick, as outlined in
  <http://www.geeklog.net/article.php?story=20020429092841722>.
- When the first character of the content of a block is a '<' it is now
  assumed that the block contains HTML and nl2br() is not applied to the
  block content. This allows proper HTML usage and even the use of Javascript
  in blocks.
- Sanity checks have been added to the admin editors (including the editor
  for static pages) to prevent possible damage to the database in case of
  incomplete translations (language files) or invalid IDs.
- The delete button in the plugin editor, which was unused since the removal
  of the automated plugin install (in Geeklog 1.3.4), will now cause a function
  plugin_uninstall_<plugin name> to be called. This allows plugins to uninstall
  themselves (if possible).
- The author's name was missing from emailed stories. Also changed it so that
  the author's name is only included when $_CONF['contributedbyline'] == 1.
  The daily digest now also includes the author's name.
- Fixed the "1054: Unknown column 'deleted' in 'where clause'" SQL error that
  some people were getting when logging out.
- Submitted stories will now pick up the permissions from the topic they were
  posted under (instead of using default permissions).
- Added new features story.submit, link.submit, event.submit which, when
  assigned to a group, allow members of that group to post directly (skipping
  the submission queue) even when the submissione queue is active.
- Fixed issues with backslashes in block titles, as suggested by Neil Darlow.
- The page navigation is now wrapped in a <div class="pagenav"> so that it
  can be formatted by a theme using CSS.
  Because of this change, the template files admin/user/userslist.thtml and
  links/links.thtml had to be changed, because they wrapped the page navigation
  in a <p>.
- Submission of links and events by anonymous users failed when the link
  submission queues were switched off.
- Anonymous users were able to submit comments even when $_CONF['loginrequired']
  was set to 1.
- Fixed a search bug introduced in 1.3.6rc1 when searching by author.
- When updating from an earlier version, the install script will no longer try
  to rename the staticpage table when no prefix is used in the database.
- PLG_getUserOptions() will no longer return empty menu options.
- Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65
- Changed some wording in the German language file
- Fixed spelling errors in the English language file


August 28, 2002 (1.3.6rc1)
---------------
- Problems with using the dollar sign in stories, comments, and their titles
  have been fixed.
- Fresh installations now have a "Are you secure?" block pre-installed
  that only the Admin can see and which does some (very simple) tests whether
  the site is secure or not.
- Fixed the page navigation in (admin's) user list.
- Using the preview in the admin story editor will now keep the topic icon
  and the time will not revert from pm to am any more.
- The links section now includes a list of the link categories at the top.
  The list of links is now also separated into pages (10 links per page by
  default, configurable in config.php).
  To get back the old (pre-1.3.6) style of the links section, just set both
  $_CONF['linkcols'] and $_CONF['linksperpage'] (in config.php) to 0.
  These changes are based on code provided by Tom Willett.
- Fixed the SQL syntax for some requests ("count(*) AS count" instead of
  "count(*) count") which seems to have caused problems with some (older)
  versions of MySQL.
- A proper error message is now displayed when attempting to use "Mail Users"
  but not filling out all the fields.
- Editing a portal block shouldn't make it disappear any more ...
- The somewhat random order of poll answers has been fixed.
- The site can be disabled by setting $_CONF['site_enabled'] = false; in
  config.php. $_CONF['site_disabled_msg'] can either contain a message to be
  displayed in that case or a URL (has to start with http:) to which all
  requests will be redirected.
- Fixed various access rights / privacy issues where users could see (but
  not access) information even when they shouldn't ...
  + Search returns only those stories, comments, links, and events to which the
    user has the proper access rights
  + What's New block counts stories and comments according to access rights
    now (this should also fix the problems some people had when New Comments
    were not displayed for anonymous users). New Links also take access rights
    into account.
  + Upcoming events are only visible to those with the proper rights.
  + Topics are not available for submissions without proper rights.
  + Topic selection in the user preferences also follows access rights.
  + "Last 10 comments" (and the new "Last 10 stories too, of course) in profile
    takes proper rights into account
- Story display and paged navigation weren't working properly when some stories
  were only accessible to certain users.
- Fixed a bug where users weren't able to use the site when their theme had
  been removed (until they cleared their cookies).
- New installations now have only two default accounts: The Admin account (as
  before) and a Moderator account that has access to the story, links, and
  events submission queues.
- The Older Stories block should work again.
- The submission queues for stories, links, events, and users can now be
  switched off separately (in config.php), i.e. items submitted by users will
  then be visible to everybody immediately.
- The database backup is more verbose now, especially when there are problems
  (changes provided by Blaine Lang).
- Fixed a bug where the admin's user photo overwrote a user's photo when the
  admin was editing the user's account information.
- Group editor:
  + Could not create new groups when using a non-english language file.
  + Once you've added one group to another (by checking off an option from
    the "Security Groups" list), there was no way to uncheck it again.
  + The message after saving/deleting a group said that the topic(!) had been
    saved/deleted ...
- Changes in search:
  + Should be faster now.
  + Search by date did not work (mostly because the date format recommended to
    be used in a search is really YYYY-MM-DD and not MM-DD-YYYY).
  + List of authors is now sorted by username.
  + Search results for links are now routed via portal.php, too, so that the
    links are counted when clicked.
  + When no results are returned for a search, then the search form will now
    be displayed below that message again.
- The static pages plugin uses the table prefix now (databases created with
  Geeklog 1.3.5 or older need to be upgraded).
- A user submission queue has been added. When activated in config.php
  ($_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1;), new users will not get their password
  emailed until they are approved by an admin.
  You can, however, let users from certain domains be approved automatically
  by adding their domain names to the comma-separated list of domains in
  $_CONF['allow_domains'].
- Fixed problems with quotes in poll question and answers.
- The default value for the number of stories per page for a new user is now
  taken from $_CONF['limitnews'] (was hard-coded to 10).
- The user profile has been extended to include
  + last 10 stories by that user
  + total number of stories and comments posted by that user
  + link to search for all postings by that user
- The title of an article is now displayed in the page title (again).
- New configuration option $_CONF['allow_user_language'] to allow / prevent
  to change the language. When set to 0, the option to switch the language
  is hidden from the user preferences.
- The message "You have successfully logged out" should not show up any more
  when you log out and log in again.
- The blocks stating that the search returned no results (e.g. for links) are
  now switched off by default but can be switched on again with the new
  configuration variable $_CONF['showemptysearchresults'].
- Fixed the list of authors in the search form (did not list all authors).
- Fixed search results for links and events: They always displayed only one
  result, even when there where more hits. Also, when searching for authors,
  no hits amongst the links and events will be returned (since they have
  no author).
- In the admin menu, the count of available submissions is now displayed
  according to the admin's access rights (e.g. don't count story submissions
  for someone who's only a link admin).
- Links in the What's New block are now counted when clicked (for the site
  statistics).
- Fixed a stray "(N/A)" that would show up in the admin menu for admins which
  were not static pages admins.
- You can now block anonymous users from accessing any part of a Geeklog site
  or you can block them from certain parts, e.g. block anonymous access to the
  calendar (via a new set of XXXloginrequired flags in config.php).
  Please note that $_CONF['loginrequired'] is now used to require login to all
  areas. To require login for submissions, use $_CONF['submitloginrequired'].
- New RDF/RSS parser, provided by Roger Webster. This should now properly
  import even those RDF feeds which Geeklog previously refused to display.
- Updated language files:
  + Italian, provided by quess65
  + Japanese, provided by Yusuke Sakata
  + Polish, provided by Robert Stadnik

  $_CONF['site_url']/admin, provided by Gene Wood.
- The static pages plugin can now wrap static pages in a block
  (available as an option in staticpages.cfg)
- You can now use [code] ... [/code] in stories and comments (HTML formatted

  any other programming language). Geeklog will then reproduce this section
  verbatim, i.e. not interpreting any special characters in that section.

- Signatures in comments are working again.
- The daily digest uses $_CONF['shortdate'] now
- New configuration variable $_CONF['emailstorieslength'] to specify the length
  of stories sent in the daily digest: 0 = only the title and a link to the
  story are included, 1 = entire introtext is included (default), any other
  number = cut off text after that amount of characters.
- The selection of the user theme is now hidden from the user's preferences
  when 'allow_user_themes' is turned off in config.php

  {charset} in header.thtml) and email sent by Geeklog.
- Changes in the themes and the admin editors, moving lots of hard-coded
  english texts to the language files.
  This affects most of the files in the admin and calendar directories within
  the themes directories.
- The static pages plugin will now pick the language automatically, based on
  the user / default setting for the language. Currently, only English and
  German language files are included.

July 8, 2002 (1.3.5sr2)

  Please note that some of the other documentation may be out of date ...
- Display of stories in older stories block was off by one day.
- Number of guest users in Who's online block should now be reset properly.
- Added some scripts in admin/install to help with the installation:
  + info.php just does a phpinfo()
  + check.php will check the file and directory permissions
  + configinfo.php will display the contents of config.php
  Note: It is now even more important that you remove the install directory
  after the installation went through (or at least block read access to this
  directory).
- Disable all onXXX Javascript events in HTML postings (stories and comments).
- Fill in user name and email address when writing an email to a user (via
  the 'send email' form from the user profile).
- Make sure that the first comment to a story has the 'title' field filled in
  (previously, only comments to comments took over the title).
- Cut off the subject at the first linefeed when sending email to a user,
  thus preventing the injection of additional email headers.
- Added a test for register_globals=off in the install script (and display a
  warning if it is off). Also added a hint what the current path is and tries
  to guess the /path/to/geeklog.
- Fixed the "12pm bug": Posting a story between 12 and 1 pm would result in
  the story being posted with a date in 1969.
- Use mysql_connect() instead of mysql_pconnect() in MySQL class.
- The redirect after submitting a story always went to /index.php
- HTML tags are now stripped out of search queries.
- Removed the logging of all search queries to error.log.
- Fixed a wrong link from personal events in the upcoming events block.
- The "Home" link in the section block was not active on pages > 1. It was,
  however, always active on the home page when the Geeklog site was not
  located in the DocumentRoot.


June 10, 2002 (1.3.5sr1)
-------------
- This release addresses security issues recently discovered by the people at
  olympos.org. These issues allow for the injection of malicious javascript
  code (which could be used to access the admin's cookie) and the injection
  of MySQL code which could be used to access and even damaged the database
  (under certain circumstances). Details will be available in a report on
  the Bugtraq list shortly after this release is out.
- The following bugs from the 1.3.5 release have also been fixed:
  + missing field 'emailfromadmin' in userprefs table (fresh installs only)
  + fixed a typo that prevented the page navigation from working
  + fixed batch user import

  voteorder (highest number of votes -> lowest) or by the order they were saved in admin/poll.php
- You can now move /admin somewhere else in web tree.  This should help out folk where ISP's use /admin
  for their administration stuff.
- if you go to submit.php as an admin we will try to send you to the admin/ page for the type of thing you
  are trying to submit (e.g. story, link, event)
- fixed calendar.php so month view now shows events spanning multiple days on months other than the current
- admin/event.php now saves am/pm and allday properly
- PollAdmin group can now properly add a new poll.

  empty array                                                                                            
- fixed moderation.php so post mode is saved properly from storysubmission to story table.

- set error_reporting() so uninitialized variables don't show up (common in poorly configured PHP installs)
- gldefault blocks now actually use permissions assigned to them in admin/block.php

  with this file.
- Added $_CONF['maximagesperarticle'] to config.php
- install.php was reworked a bit for upcoming release
- lib-common.php has changed.  can't even begin to note all the changes there
- admin/user.php has a very simple batch import utility.  You can now create multiple
  accounts by importing a tab-delimited file.  See that page for file format specs
- story.php was reworked a bit to be simplified and to correctly do paging (old
  paging feature had a bug where one article would never show up.                                                                            
- admin/user.php now allows for paging and searching.  Check it out, you'll see what I mean ;-)
- blocks can now be disabled in admin/block.php
- added support for images in articles
- complete overhauled upload.class.php for ease of use, better security, better logging
  and for use in putting images in articles.

  usernames to be created.
- New strings in english.php (and german.php):
  $LANG02: 15 (moved from calendar_event.php)
  $LANG04: 74, 75, 76 (moved from usersettings.php)
  $LANG08: 31, 32, 33, 34 (moved from lib-common.php)
  These strings need to be added to the other language files!
- Fixed user selection of emailed topics (usersettings.php) and removed the
  hard coded texts for the daily digest from lib-common.php (again).
- Slightly changed display of event block: The type of event is no longer
  underlined and the event date is displayed as 03-Apr etc.
- Added Russion Translation
- Fixed bug #531483 where $_CONF['commentsloginrequired'] was set to 'on' or
  'off' instead of '1' or '0'.

  lib-common.php

  in lib-common.php
- Fixed bug #531018: {contributedby_use} had an 'r' too many in lib-common.php

  valid HTML. Nearly all those change fall into one of the following categories:
  + changed '&' in URLs to '&amp;'
  + added alt="" to <img> tags
  + changed the script tags to <script type="text/javascript">
  + changed the DOCTYPE to HTML 4.01 (there is a bug in the HTML 4.0
    specification which prevents the use of 'name' attributes in forms).
  + added '#' signs in front of colour values (mostly in the Classic theme)
  These kinds of changes have also been applied to index.php and lib-common.php
- During those changes for valid HTML, some typos were corrected:
  + Classic/header.thtml: added a missing <b> before {welcome_message}
  + Classic/storytext.thtml: added a missing 'n' in {end_contributedby_anchortag}
  + Yahoo/header.thml referred to a non-existent file "spec.gif"
  + Yahoo/footer.thml: there was an extra quote after align="right"
  + Digital_Monochrom/admin/plugins/editor.thml: file was missing - copied
    over from the Classic theme)
  + Digital_Monochrom/footer.thtml: added a missing ';' after &nbsp
- admin/install/install.php had two <body> tags but was missing the </head>

March 7, 2002
-----------------
- Fixed broken older stories block (lib-common.php)
- Fixed problems with saving rights to a group in admin/group.php (admin/group.php)
- Fixed bug in admin/user that would reset user's settings when admin made a change (admin/user.php)
- Fixed bug in index.php.  There were two FOR loops, one nested inside the other both interating
  on the variable $i.  This caused problems only for users who went into display preferences and
  selected only the topics they wanted to get articles for (index.php)
- Fixed bug in story admin that would prevent the date edit from prepopulating right when admin hit
  the preview button (admin/story.php)
- Modified admin/plugin.php to reflect change in how plugins are installed.  Because of platform 
  dependance issues, all plugins will have a simple but manual installation process.  This should
  work across all platforms. (admin/plugin.php, layout/Yahoo/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml,
  layout/Classic/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Digital_Monochrome/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml)
- Alter the database to force all stories to show on the frontpage by default.  This will make the
  moderation of articles work as expected.  Before if you approved an article it would show up only
  in the topic and not on the frontpage (mysql_tableanddata.sql, table.sql, mysql_1.3.3_to_1.3.4.sql)

March 1, 2002
-----------------
- Admins can now manually edit the publish date of an article.  This include the ability
  to set the date for a time in the future.  In that case the article is completely 
  ignored by COM_exportRDF, stats.php, search.php and the email digest
- Rudimentary support for database backups (one per day at most).  There is no restore
  capability at this time.
- Modified the display preference so we store the blocks a user doesn't want to see instead
  of the ones they do want to see.  This will allow any new block to show up by default as
  expected.
- Removed hardcoded english from COM_emailUserTopics
- Fixed minor security bug with whats new block. It would display items the user didn't have access too (however, if they click them they would correctly get the access denied message)

January 11, 2001
-----------------

Prior to this you could change the permanent cookie to any user and get their access rights.  Second security fix addresses an orphaned group_assignments record that, one new Geeklog installations, would give the very first user to register with the site access to the GroupAdmin and UserAdmin groups

July 8, 2000
------------

  pollids and timestamps, votes are NOT tracked!
  Addresses are deleted after an admin specified 
  peroid of time set with the config.php variable
  $CONF["polladdresstime"].
- Added $CONF["pollcookietime"] to config.php to
  allow you to set the amount of time the poll
  cookies will exist for the user.
- Changed poll to only show a % in the smaller
  index window.  Graphs are now only on the full
  view of the results.
- Added SQL query interface for admins.  This was
  added for those that don't have shell access or
  shell access isn't alaways avaiable for 
  troubleshooting.  Be VERY careful with this!

  HTTP calls!  This was causing the server to 
  lock up under certian circumstances.
- Update showblocks() to now order polls and
  olderstuff as well.  Here's the new method:

  is going to be the bigest DB update script yet!

  introtext block and bodytext block.  Introtext
  is all that is displayed on the index page.
  Both introtext and bodytext are displayed on
  an article page.  There are many other neat
  things that have changed to go along with this,
  too many to mention!  An example is "read more"
  is only displayed when there is data in bodytext.

  his site was coded in there.

  wasn't working properly under Netscape.

  $CONF["topicsort"].

  Some of the new feilds are for future use as well.

  calls.  Let the client do the work!

  function.  Smaller...  Faster... More Stable!
- Only 6 more items on the to do list for 0.1.0.0

June 20, 2000
-------------

- Created admin functions for the pollbooth.  Seems the 
  other authors on the site don't like hand entering SQL!
  I don't like them having shell accounts!  -grin-
- Update the Header feild in the Stories block to be a 
  little bigger.  This should let wordy authors emblish
  their titles more!
- Created a more robust errorlog routine.  Now has the
  options of output to a log, the screen or both!

June 19, 2000
-------------

- Created a pollbooth for voting.  All user functions are
  in pollbooth.php.  There are no admin functions yet as I
  just love hand entering SQL!

June 18, 2000
-------------

- Optimizations made to the SQL connections and calls.  Too
  much done here to talk about, but part of it was moving 
  the site configuration to a flat file.  These changes
  should decrease the usage of the SQL server a great deal.
  This took up most of my day.
- Variable usage optimizations.  Made many, many chnages in
  the way variables were being used.  This should result in
  cleaner, faster code that _may_ use a little less memory?
  Hey, if I can save 2k per hit, thats a big deal! :-)
- Updated all code and tested to ensure php4 compatibility.
  So from now on only php4 will be run on the Geeks web
  servers.  So I changed all the extentions and links from
  .php3 to .php to mark this moment.
- Restructured the directory layout so I can implement some
  new security settings on the files.  Hmmm, I bet you 
  wondering "what is this mad-man thinking?"

June 17, 2000
-------------

- Initial announcement, running this new code on the Geeks
  web servers.
- Special thanks to Jason Hines and phpWebLog! His work 
  inspired much of my efforts!  Unfortunatly phpWebLog is 
  taking a different direction that the Geeks sites needed.
  However, all the code I am writing here will be published
  in the hopes that Jason and others may find these functions
  useful.  If you looking for a weblog software that is cool,
  configurable and supported by someone I would recommend you
  check out http://phpweblog.org and party on dudes!
