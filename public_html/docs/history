GeekLog History/Changes:

- The database backup is more verbose now, especially when there are problems
  (changes provided by Blaine Lang).
- Fixed a bug where the admin's user photo overwrote a user's photo when the
  admin was editing the user's account information.
- Group editor:
  + Could not create new groups when using a non-english language file.
  + Once you've added one group to another (by checking off an option from
    the "Security Groups" list), there was no way to uncheck it again.
  + The message after saving/deleting a group said that the topic(!) had been
    saved/deleted ...
- Changes in search:
  + Should be faster now.
  + Search by date did not work (mostly because the date format recommended to
    be used in a search is really YYYY-MM-DD and not MM-DD-YYYY).
  + List of authors is now sorted by username.
  + Search results for links are now routed via portal.php, too, so that the
    links are counted when clicked.
- The static pages plugin uses the table prefix now (databases created with
  Geeklog 1.3.5 or older need to be upgraded).
- A user submission queue has been added. When activated in config.php
  ($_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1;), new users will not get their password
  emailed until they are approved by an admin.
- Fixed problems with quotes in poll question and answers.
- The default value for the number of stories per page for a new user is now
  taken from $_CONF['limitnews'] (was hard-coded to 10).
- The user profile has been extended to include
  + last 10 stories by that user
  + total number of stories and comments posted by that user
  + link to search for all postings by that user
- The title of an article is now displayed in the page title (again).
- New configuration option $_CONF['allow_user_language'] to allow / prevent
  to change the language. When set to 0, the option to switch the language
  is hidden from the user preferences.
- The message "You have successfully logged out" should not show up any more
  when you log out and log in again.
- The blocks stating that the search returned no results (e.g. for links) are
  now switched off by default but can be switched on again with the new
  configuration variable $_CONF['showemptysearchresults'].
- Fixed the list of authors in the search form (did not list all authors).
- Fixed search results for links and events: They always displayed only one
  result, even when there where more hits. Also, when searching for authors,
  no hits amongst the links and events will be returned (since they have
  no author).
- In the admin menu, the count of available submissions is now displayed
  according to the admin's access rights (e.g. don't count story submissions
  for someone who's only a link admin).
- Links in the What's New block are now counted when clicked (for the site
  statistics).
- Fixed a stray "(N/A)" that would show up in the admin menu for admins which
  were not static pages admins.
- You can now block anonymous users from accessing any part of a Geeklog site
  or you can block them from certain parts, e.g. block anonymous access to the
  calendar (via a new set of XXXloginrequired flags in config.php).
  Please note that $_CONF['loginrequired'] is now used to require login to all
  areas. To require login for submissions, use $_CONF['submitloginrequired'].
- New RDF/RSS parser, provided by Roger Webster. This should now properly
  import even those RDF feeds which Geeklog previously refused to display.
- Updated language files:
  + Italian, provided by quess65
  + Japanese, provided by Yusuke Sakata
  + Polish, provided by Robert Stadnik
- Various fixes for the consistent use of $_CONF['site_admin_url'] instead of
  $_CONF['site_url']/admin, provided by Gene Wood.
- The static pages plugin can now wrap static pages in a block
  (available as an option in staticpages.cfg)
- You can now use [code] ... [/code] in stories and comments (HTML formatted
  only) to mark portions of the text as containing code of any form (HTML, PHP,
  any other programming language). Geeklog will then reproduce this section
  verbatim, i.e. not interpreting any special characters in that section.
- Fixed type pulldown menu in search when more than one plugin was used.
- Signatures in comments are working again.
- The daily digest uses $_CONF['shortdate'] now
- New configuration variable $_CONF['emailstorieslength'] to specify the length
  of stories sent in the daily digest: 0 = only the title and a link to the
  story are included, 1 = entire introtext is included (default), any other
  number = cut off text after that amount of characters.
- The selection of the user theme is now hidden from the user's preferences
  when 'allow_user_themes' is turned off in config.php
- The links "Add To My Calendar" are now hidden when personal calendars are
  turned off in config.php
- Fixed a bug where the number of submissions was displayed in the sections
  block even when that was turned off.
- New variable $_CONF['adminhtml'] allows (Story)Admin to use a wider variety
  of HTML tags than the ordinary user.
- Fixed COM_exportRDF so that only articles that anonymous users have access to
  show up.
- Search: User drop down only shows users that have posted a comment or a story.
- Fixed bug with double quotes in title of story submission.
- The upcoming events block uses the list templates now.
- The story option block uses the list templates now.
- The (Event)Admin could not delete events (delete button was missing).
- The calendar class reverted to using the english day and month names as
  soon as you called setCalendarMatrix().
- Added {edit_link} in story templates in Classic theme.
- All admin editors have the save / cancel / delete buttons at the bottom now.
- The link to the plugin homepage did not work from the plugin editor.
- Added $_CONF['default_charset'] in config.php and $LANG_CHARSET in the
  language files to specify a character set to be used for the web pages (use
  {charset} in header.thtml) and email sent by Geeklog.
- Changes in the themes and the admin editors, moving lots of hard-coded
  english texts to the language files.
  This affects most of the files in the admin and calendar directories within
  the themes directories.
- The static pages plugin will now picks the language automatically, based on
  the user / default setting for the language. Currently, only English and
  German language files are included.
- New variables that can be used in footer.thtml: {execution_textandtime},
  {powered_by}.


July 8, 2002 (1.3.5sr2)
-------------
- New installation instructions (now back in docs/install.html).
  Please note that some of the other documentation may be out of date ...
- Display of stories in older stories block was off by one day.
- Number of guest users in Who's online block should now be reset properly.
- Added some scripts in admin/install to help with the installation:
  + info.php just does a phpinfo()
  + check.php will check the file and directory permissions
  + configinfo.php will display the contents of config.php
  Note: It is now even more important that you remove the install directory
  after the installation went through (or at least block read access to this
  directory).
- Disable all onXXX Javascript events in HTML postings (stories and comments).
- Fill in user name and email address when writing an email to a user (via
  the 'send email' form from the user profile).
- Make sure that the first comment to a story has the 'title' field filled in
  (previously, only comments to comments took over the title).
- Cut off the subject at the first linefeed when sending email to a user,
  thus preventing the injection of additional email headers.
- Added a test for register_globals=off in the install script (and display a
  warning if it is off). Also added a hint what the current path is and tries
  to guess the /path/to/geeklog.
- Fixed the "12pm bug": Posting a story between 12 and 1 pm would result in
  the story being posted with a date in 1969.
- Use mysql_connect() instead of mysql_pconnect() in MySQL class.
- The redirect after submitting a story always went to /index.php
- HTML tags are now stripped out of search queries.
- Removed the logging of all search queries to error.log.
- Fixed a wrong link from personal events in the upcoming events block.
- The "Home" link in the section block was not active on pages > 1. It was,
  however, always active on the home page when the Geeklog site was not
  located in the DocumentRoot.


June 10, 2002 (1.3.5sr1)
-------------
- This release addresses security issues recently discovered by the people at
  olympos.org. These issues allow for the injection of malicious javascript
  code (which could be used to access the admin's cookie) and the injection
  of MySQL code which could be used to access and even damaged the database
  (under certain circumstances). Details will be available in a report on
  the Bugtraq list shortly after this release is out.
- The following bugs from the 1.3.5 release have also been fixed:
  + missing field 'emailfromadmin' in userprefs table (fresh installs only)
  + fixed a typo that prevented the page navigation from working
  + fixed batch user import
  + fixed logo size and path to search in XSilver theme
  + optimized size of image files in XSilver theme
  + fixed path to search in Clean theme


April 24, 2002 (1.3.5)
--------------
- Change installation so that server configuration is manual, DB configuration is scripted
- Search page now properly generates the right link to search comments
- Comments to polls now show up in whats new block
- You can now specify the order the poll results show up in in config.php.  You can either sort by
  voteorder (highest number of votes -> lowest) or by the order they were saved in admin/poll.php
- You can now move /admin somewhere else in web tree.  This should help out folk where ISP's use /admin
  for their administration stuff.
- if you go to submit.php as an admin we will try to send you to the admin/ page for the type of thing you
  are trying to submit (e.g. story, link, event)
- fixed calendar.php so month view now shows events spanning multiple days on months other than the current
- admin/event.php now saves am/pm and allday properly
- PollAdmin group can now properly add a new poll.
- fixed SEC_getUserGroups() so that it always returns an array even if no groups are returned (e.g.
  empty array                                                                                            
- fixed moderation.php so post mode is saved properly from storysubmission to story table.
- killed 1064 bug in admin/event.php
- set error_reporting() so uninitialized variables don't show up (common in poorly configured PHP installs)
- gldefault blocks now actually use permissions assigned to them in admin/block.php
- Added all sorts of shit to english.php.  Translators will need to really take their time
  with this file.
- Added $_CONF['maximagesperarticle'] to config.php
- install.php was reworked a bit for upcoming release
- lib-common.php has changed.  can't even begin to note all the changes there
- admin/user.php has a very simple batch import utility.  You can now create multiple
  accounts by importing a tab-delimited file.  See that page for file format specs
- story.php was reworked a bit to be simplified and to correctly do paging (old
  paging feature had a bug where one article would never show up.                                                                            
- admin/user.php now allows for paging and searching.  Check it out, you'll see what I mean ;-)
- blocks can now be disabled in admin/block.php
- added support for images in articles
- complete overhauled upload.class.php for ease of use, better security, better logging
  and for use in putting images in articles.
- fixed bug in users.php that allows accounts with same email addresses yet different
  usernames to be created.
- New strings in english.php (and german.php):
  $LANG02: 15 (moved from calendar_event.php)
  $LANG04: 74, 75, 76 (moved from usersettings.php)
  $LANG08: 31, 32, 33, 34 (moved from lib-common.php)
  These strings need to be added to the other language files!
- Fixed user selection of emailed topics (usersettings.php) and removed the
  hard coded texts for the daily digest from lib-common.php (again).
- Slightly changed display of event block: The type of event is no longer
  underlined and the event date is displayed as 03-Apr etc.
- Added Russion Translation
- Fixed bug #531483 where $_CONF['commentsloginrequired'] was set to 'on' or
  'off' instead of '1' or '0'.
- Fixed bug #529621 and added the variable layout_url in COM_endBlock in
  lib-common.php
- (Sort of) fixed bug #530142: {geeklog_blocks} is now set to an empty string
  in lib-common.php
- Fixed bug #531018: {contributedby_use} had an 'r' too many in lib-common.php
- There have been lots of minor changes in the themes so that they now contain
  valid HTML. Nearly all those change fall into one of the following categories:
  + changed '&' in URLs to '&amp;'
  + added alt="" to <img> tags
  + changed the script tags to <script type="text/javascript">
  + changed the DOCTYPE to HTML 4.01 (there is a bug in the HTML 4.0
    specification which prevents the use of 'name' attributes in forms).
  + added '#' signs in front of colour values (mostly in the Classic theme)
  These kinds of changes have also been applied to index.php and lib-common.php
- During those changes for valid HTML, some typos were corrected:
  + Classic/header.thtml: added a missing <b> before {welcome_message}
  + Classic/storytext.thtml: added a missing 'n' in {end_contributedby_anchortag}
  + Yahoo/header.thml referred to a non-existent file "spec.gif"
  + Yahoo/footer.thml: there was an extra quote after align="right"
  + Digital_Monochrom/admin/plugins/editor.thml: file was missing - copied
    over from the Classic theme)
  + Digital_Monochrom/footer.thtml: added a missing ';' after &nbsp
- admin/install/install.php had two <body> tags but was missing the </head>

March 7, 2002
-----------------
- Fixed broken older stories block (lib-common.php)
- Fixed problems with saving rights to a group in admin/group.php (admin/group.php)
- Fixed bug in admin/user that would reset user's settings when admin made a change (admin/user.php)
- Fixed bug in index.php.  There were two FOR loops, one nested inside the other both interating
  on the variable $i.  This caused problems only for users who went into display preferences and
  selected only the topics they wanted to get articles for (index.php)
- Fixed bug in story admin that would prevent the date edit from prepopulating right when admin hit
  the preview button (admin/story.php)
- Modified admin/plugin.php to reflect change in how plugins are installed.  Because of platform 
  dependance issues, all plugins will have a simple but manual installation process.  This should
  work across all platforms. (admin/plugin.php, layout/Yahoo/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml,
  layout/Classic/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Digital_Monochrome/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml)
- Alter the database to force all stories to show on the frontpage by default.  This will make the
  moderation of articles work as expected.  Before if you approved an article it would show up only
  in the topic and not on the frontpage (mysql_tableanddata.sql, table.sql, mysql_1.3.3_to_1.3.4.sql)

March 1, 2002
-----------------
- Admins can now manually edit the publish date of an article.  This include the ability
  to set the date for a time in the future.  In that case the article is completely 
  ignored by COM_exportRDF, stats.php, search.php and the email digest
- Rudimentary support for database backups (one per day at most).  There is no restore
  capability at this time.
- Modified the display preference so we store the blocks a user doesn't want to see instead
  of the ones they do want to see.  This will allow any new block to show up by default as
  expected.
- Removed hardcoded english from COM_emailUserTopics
- Fixed minor security bug with whats new block. It would display items the user didn't have access too (however, if they click them they would correctly get the access denied message)
- Topic administration page now default the group to 'Topic Admin' properly
- Topic administration now save anonymous permissions properly

January 11, 2001
-----------------
- Two security fixes, one major one.  This release addes a users MD5 password to a cookie that is checked when using the permanent cookie.  Prior to this you could change the permanent cookie to any user and get their access rights.  Second security fix addresses an orphaned group_assignments record that, one new Geeklog installations, would give the very first user to register with the site access to the GroupAdmin and UserAdmin groups
- In admin/block.php you can now specify the URL to a help file.  This is usefully in providing site help to your users

  other authors on the site don't like hand entering SQL!

  little bigger.  This should let wordy authors emblish
  their titles more!

June 19, 2000
-------------

  in pollbooth.php.  There are no admin functions yet as I
  just love hand entering SQL!

June 18, 2000
-------------

- Optimizations made to the SQL connections and calls.  Too
  much done here to talk about, but part of it was moving 
  the site configuration to a flat file.  These changes
  should decrease the usage of the SQL server a great deal.
  This took up most of my day.
- Variable usage optimizations.  Made many, many chnages in
  the way variables were being used.  This should result in
  cleaner, faster code that _may_ use a little less memory?
  Hey, if I can save 2k per hit, thats a big deal! :-)
- Updated all code and tested to ensure php4 compatibility.
  So from now on only php4 will be run on the Geeks web
  servers.  So I changed all the extentions and links from
  .php3 to .php to mark this moment.
- Restructured the directory layout so I can implement some
  new security settings on the files.  Hmmm, I bet you 
  wondering "what is this mad-man thinking?"

June 17, 2000
-------------

- Initial announcement, running this new code on the Geeks
  web servers.
- Special thanks to Jason Hines and phpWebLog! His work 
  inspired much of my efforts!  Unfortunatly phpWebLog is 
  taking a different direction that the Geeks sites needed.
  However, all the code I am writing here will be published
  in the hopes that Jason and others may find these functions
  useful.  If you looking for a weblog software that is cool,
  configurable and supported by someone I would recommend you
  check out http://phpweblog.org and party on dudes!
