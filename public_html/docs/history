+ New Configuration GUI (replacing config.php) by Aaron Blankstein
+ New Webservices API based on the Atom Publishing Protocol by Ramnath R. Iyer

Changes since 1.5.0rc2:
- Users that used a different theme than the site default would see the site
  switch temporarily back to the site's default theme when changing a config
  option. This was a side effect of the fix for bug #0000648 [Dirk]
- In a tradeoff between security and convenience, we decided to go with
  security: The install script will no longer display the database credentials
  from db-config.php. The downside is that you will have to enter them again
  when doing a database upgrade or re-running the install (reported by Mark
  Evans) [Dirk]

  title of the public list of links (reported by Markus Wollschläger) [Dirk]

  Topics blocks. Added new blockheader-list.thtml, blockfooter-list.thtml
  template files for those blocks [Blaine]
- Removed the fake {blockid} for the block templates as it was actually derived
  from the block title, resulting in layout changes when you changed the block
  title. It also didn't work properly with non-ASCII languages. Updated
  style.css and the block templates accordingly [Blaine]
- Fixed setting the site's default language and default theme (bugs #0000646
  and #0000648) [Aaron, Dirk]

- Hard-coded the text direction as "ltr" for some input fields and the date/time
  selection in the story editor (bug #0000150). Also removed "text-align:left"

  character for the regexp [Dirk]

  registration, story and comment submission as well as the contact user and
  email story forms. These hooks can be used to add CAPTCHAs to those forms,
  but may also come in handy for other plugin applications.
  Also modified several template files to include a {captcha} variable to ease

  messed up) [Dirk]
- Editing a story did reset the trackback count (reported by T. Marquez) [Dirk]
- In the admin's story editor, set the debug option for the image upload only
  when $_CONF['debug_image_upload']  = true (thus avoiding the "Warning: File #x
  on the HTML form was empty" messages in error.log) [Dirk]
- Renamed [calendar:] autotag back to [event:] for backward compatibility. It
  also makes more sense this way, since it does provide a link to an event, not

- Need to check if field 'etids' is NULL (for MySQL 4) for the Daily Digest
  (bug #595) [Dirk]

  overwrite $_CONF['date'] depending on the current language [Dirk]
- When installing the Geeklog database using InnoDB tables, create a
  'database_engine' entry in gl_vars, so that plugins know to use InnoDB for

  variables in the story templates [Dirk]

  Samuel M. Stone
- Updated Japanese language files for Geeklog and all the plugins, provided
  by the Geeklog Japanese group
- Updated Ukrainian language files (Windows-1251, KOI8-U, and UTF-8 encoding)
  for Geeklog and all the plugins, provided by Vitaliy Biliyenko

  [Oliver]

- Moved the defines for STORY_ARCHIVE_ON_EXPIRE and STORY_DELETE_ON_EXPIRE to
  lib-story.php (from config.php) where they make more sense [Dirk]

- When comments are disabled for a story, don't show any existing comments in
  the What's New block, in search results or via comment.php (bug #597) [Dirk]

  Command and Control (moderation.php) [Dirk]
- For Block, Group, Polls, Story and Topic Admins only display the number of

  entries, e.g. topics, in the system) [Dirk]
- Fixed highlighting parse error when the search term contained an apostrophe
  (bug #590) [Dirk]

  the $_CONF['check_trackback_link'] settings [Dirk]

- When upgrading the database from 1.4.0, only update those plugins that are

Calendar plugin
---------------
- Created a dedicated stylesheet file and include the file only if the URL
  contains the word 'calendar' [Oliver]
- Tweaked the Calendar search result listing: Removed the Event Description
  (usually too long for the result listing), replaced Location (which is only a
  part of the address and not very helpful) with Event Type, minimized Date &
  Time display for events lasting only one day (don't list date twice) [Dirk]

Links plugin
------------
- Renamed classes block-vote-results to poll-vote-results and block-vote to
  poll-vote [Oliver]
- Removed duplicate "Other" entry from the Link submission form [Dirk]
- In the Admin's list of links, only display an edit icon for links that the

  trying to edit such a link, though) [Dirk]
- Don't return the number of links in the links submission queue if the
  current user does not have links.moderate permissions [Dirk]
- Filter out special characters from link IDs. They were properly escaped

- Don't display an "edit" link in a story if the current user doesn't have
  edit permissions for the story's topic (bug #558) [Dirk]

  old users and allows mass-deletion of those [Oliver]

  You can select if this group is an Admin Group [Blaine]
- Added ability to multi-select submission queue items on the moderation page
  and delete them all at once [Blaine]
- Always make "Submissions" the first entry in the Admins Only block to keep
  the correspondence between the other entries and the icons on the moderation
  page undisturbed (and because it's an important entry) [Dirk]
- Fixed 'emailstoriesperdefault' config option (bug #553) [Dirk]
- Added support for Microsoft SQL Server, provided by Randy Kolenko

- Added a spam check to the email user form [Dirk]
- Use the same piece of code to compare plugin version numbers in lib-admin.php
  and admin/plugins.php to avoid the "update" button not appearing for some
  version numbers (bug #542) [Dirk]
- Re-implemented $_CONF['allow_domains'] whitelist (when the user submission
  queue is enabled) that was inexplicably missing from 1.4.0 [Dirk]
- Merged User Preferences and Account information into one page, like the
  Story editor with tabs etc. [Blaine, Oliver]
- Tried to make "3 new stories in the last 1 day" sound less awkward by going
  back one unit, i.e. "3 new stories in the last 24 hours", in the What's New
  block (likewise for 1 week, 1 month, etc.) [Dirk]
- Introduced config options to set the default for the story's draft flag
  and frontpage option (feature request #163) [Dirk]
- Introduced $_CONF['hide_main_page_navigation'] to hide the "Google paging"
  from index.php (may be useful for some layouts) [Dirk]
- Allow (optional) usage of autotags in "normal" blocks (can be enabled /
  disabled per block) [Dirk]
- Introduced a {story_counter} variable in the story templates. It's 0 on the
  article page and in previews, but 1 for the first story, 2 for the second,
  etc. on the index page (per page, i.e. starts with 1 again on the second page)
  [Dirk]
- Require that users enter their current password when changing their password,
  email address or "Remember me for" setting. Redesigned the Account Information
  page and added a note about this requirement. [Dirk]
- Prevent accidental banning of users when the Admin edits a user's information
  using a theme that wasn't updated for Geeklog 1.4.0+ [Dirk]
- $_CONF['show_fullname'] now works as expected, i.e. when setting it to = 1,
  a user's full name will be displayed everywhere in Geeklog instead of the
  username (assuming the users entered their full name) [Dirk]
- Fixed a bug in the article directory where December was not listed when no
  stories had been posted in that month (reported by Kino and Ivy of geeklog.jp)
- Replace Geeklog's [imageX] tags before extracting the What's Related links
  from a story to prevent the (verbatim) tag to show up in the block [Dirk]
- Update story ids in the gl_trackback table when a story's id is changed [Mike]

  actions in case spam has been detected through some other means (e.g.

  don't have to retype everything in case of an error [Dirk]
- In the Admin's user list, banned users are indicated by striked-through
  entries (based on a hack by Andy Maloney) [Dirk]
- Added new setting $_CONF['onlyrootfeatures']. This is for sites where two or
  more story admins can feature stories that the other admins cannot see. The
  setting prevents that one admin does not see that there is another recent
  story featured and sets one by himself, "stealing" the feature from the other.
- Changed "Reply"-button to "Post a comment" [Oliver]
- Implemented an error handler to supress all PHP level errors and display a
  much more userfriendly error text to the end user. Prevents all path exposure,
  prevents "white error page" mystery debugging fun. [Mike]
- Full sweep of all code for $_REQUEST/$_GET/$_POST and $_COOKIE use. Made sure
  that COM_applyFilter, or other safe usage is made of the variables. [Mike]
- Added an option to hide the "No News To Display" message on the index page
  (new config option $_CONF['hide_no_news_msg']) [Dirk]

  to our site (see $_CONF['check_trackback_link'] in config.php) [Dirk]
- Made it impossible to save two syndication feeds with identical filenames
  [Oliver]
- Stories with comments/trackbacks disabled, do not show comment/trackback
  url in RSS feeds [Mike]
- Added email confirmation fields for new user and usersettings [Oliver]
- Allow changing of group ownership for "gldefault" blocks. Requires a change
  in admin/block/defaultblockeditor.thtml to enable the group dropdown. On a
  fresh install, all the blocks (with the exception of "Are you secure?") are
  now owned by the Block Admin group [Dirk]
- Users created by a User Admin should not be queued for approval, even when
  $_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1 [Dirk]
- Introduced 'syndication.edit' permission and 'Syndication Admin' group so
  that access to the Content Syndication panel no longer requires 'Root'
  permissions [Dirk]
- For the "Submissions" entry in the Admins Only block, only count story and
  event submissions when the current user has story.moderate or event.moderate
  permissions, respectively [Dirk]
- On admin/moderation.php, list the stories that have their draft flag set only

January 8, 2008 (1.4.0sr6)
---------------

MustLive pointed out a possible XSS in the form to email an article to a
friend that we're fixing with this release.


July 23, 2006 (1.4.0sr5-1)
-------------

This release fixes display problems in the comment preview that were only
introduced in Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 (as a result of the fix for the XSS).

The complete 1.4.0sr5-1 tarball also includes the following language files:

- New Afrikaans language file, provided by Renier Maritz
- Updated Hebrew language file, provided by LWC
- Updated Turkish language file, provided by Kemal Cellat


July 16, 2006 (1.4.0sr5)
-------------

JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible XSS in the comment handling that we're
fixing with this release.


June 30, 2006 (1.4.0sr4)
-------------

Two exploits have been released by "rgod" for insecure Geeklog installations
and for a bug in the "mcpuk" file manager that we've been shipping as part of
FCKeditor in all 1.4.0 releases.

- Some of the files outside of the public_html directory were not protected
  against direct execution. If Geeklog was installed such that those files were
  accessible from a URL (which has always been strongly discouraged in the
  installation instructions) then those files could be used to load and
  execute malicious code from a remote server.

  More information: http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/so-called-exploit

  In this release, we've added the missing execution prevention for all files
  outside of public_html. We would still, however, suggest that you fix your
  Geeklog install if the files outside of public_html are accessible from a URL.

- The "mcpuk" file manager that we've integrated into FCKeditor allowed the
  upload of arbitrary PHP code (even if FCKeditor was disabled in Geeklog's
  config.php). Depending on your webserver's configuration, it was then possible
  to execute that uploaded code.

  More information:
  http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/exploit-for-fckeditor-filemanager

  The file manager has been removed from this release. You will therefore no
  longer be able to upload files, e.g. images, through FCKeditor. Future
  versions of Geeklog will ship with an updated version of FCKeditor and its
  included file manager.

Nov 20, 2005 (1.4.0b1)
------------

- Introduced {start_storylink_anchortag} and {end_storylink_anchortag} template
  variables in the story and commentbar template files which only produce a

  frontpage (i.e. have not been set to "Show only in topic", bug #408) [Dirk]
- Fixed problems with query highlighting in stories scrambling links in
  autotags (bug #492) [Dirk]
- Group names are now unique (as they should have been from the beginning). The
  install script takes care of existing duplicate group names when upgrading

- Allow for more topic IDs in the user's preferences (bug #490) [Dirk]
- Replace autotags in the Daily Digest (bug #484) [Dirk]
- Explicitly link to /docs/index.html for the documentation link in the Admin's
  block (bug #504) [Dirk]
- Added an option to enable / disable trackbacks per story (just like you can
  enable / disable comments per story) [Dirk]
- Changed COM_optionList to check for language arrays which override the text
  strings that are embedded in the database (for comment mode, featured story,
  post mode, etc.) Bug #227 [Dirk]
- Fixed Bug #174 -- quotes in titles are no longer double htmlentized [Vinny]
- The default permissions for new objects (stories, topics, blocks, etc.) can
  now be set in config.php (feature request #90) [Dirk]
- Added an "Active users" entry to the site statistics. If Geeklog is configured
  to track a user's last login, this will display the number of users who
  logged into the site during the last 4 weeks. Otherwise, it displays the
  number of user accounts with status = 3 (i.e. have logged into their account
  at least once and haven't been banned) [Dirk]
- Introduced a new plugin API function so that the plugin's summary (e.g.
  number of items) can be properly integrated with the "Site Stats" section.
  Modified stats/sitestatistics.thtml, removed stats/stats.thtml, added
  stats/singlesummary.thtml template files [Dirk]
- Introduced a generic function, USER_getPhoto, which provides the user's photo,
  if available. The function also supports getting the user's avatar from
  gravatar.com (if enabled in config.php) [Dirk]
- The texts in the What's New block ("x new stories in the last y hours",
  "last 2 weeks", etc.) now properly reflect the actual settings of the
  $_CONF['newXXXinterval'] variables (bug #390) [Oliver, Dirk]
- Introduced a method to signal a forced update for feeds in case the content
  of one of the feed entries has changed  - so far, we only checked if entries
  had been added or removed (bug #277) [Dirk]
- Added $_CONF['show_right_blocks'] option which, if set = true, will display
  right-side blocks on all pages (also addresses feature request #31) [Dirk]
- Fixed bug #454, SQL error when reading comments. [Vinny]
- Leave off the "page=1" parameter on the "Google paging" navigation bar for
  links that point back to the first page [Dirk]
- The default feed for a new site is now in RSS 2.0 format and named
  "geeklog.rss" [Mike, Dirk]
- Added time of the day to the name of the database backups to allow several
  backups a day [Oliver]
- When the search returns no results, the search form is now pre-populated
  with the last search query, so that it can be changed easily. On successful
  searches, a "refine search" link will appear that also takes you back to a
  pre-populated search form (to refine your search, obviously) [Dirk]
- Changed search to only return a certain amount of hits per page, thus
  avoiding timeouts on servers where the script execution time is limited
  (bug #274) [Dirk]
  A new config variable, $_CONF['num_search_results'], defines the number of
  search results to be returned per page (and per type). The search form also
  includes a drop-down menu where this can be changed for every search.
  Plugins will have to indicate if they support this "paged" search. Otherwise,
  Geeklog will fake the paging for the plugin, so that the plugin does a full
  search for every page, but Geeklog will only display the hits for the current
  page (such a plugin can therefore still cause a timeout until it is changed
  to support "paged" searching).
- Added a permanent link to comments (in the professional theme) [Vinny]
- Added new icons for the admin sections and made sure each admin section
  now has an icon in admin/moderation.php [Dirk]
  The new icons have been taken from the Gnome project (some of them modified
  by Jakub Steiner). They are released under the GPL.
- Introduced global variable $_IMAGE_TYPE that specifies the image type to
  use. Defaults to 'gif'. Themes can override it to use other images types,
  e.g. PNG, for all images [Dirk]
- Added option to upload topic icons (Feature Request #415, Patch #423),
  provided by Alford Deeley (machinari)
- Changed the Admin's "Command and Control" center such that there is an icon
  for every entry in the Admin's block [Dirk]
- Removed duplicate code for creating a "topic SQL" query in moderation.php
  (use COM_getTopicSQL instead) [Dirk]
- Added the ability to allow users to login via defined remote services (ships
  with Blogger and LiveJournal support) [Mike]
- Added the ability to ban users, and to tell when a user has logged in at least
  once [Mike]
- Added edit-icon, List-Sorting, searching, Limits & alternating row colors
  in admin menus for groups, syndication, staticpages, trackback
  (where not yet done) [Oliver]
- Added function to allow user-defined scaling of images in articles by using
  [unscaledX] instead of [imageX] [Oliver]
- Removed $_CONF['whosonline_fullname'] option - use $_CONF['show_fullname']
  instead [Dirk]
- Fixed bug where extra slashes appeared when previewing comments [Vinny]
- Removed the "lastvisit" cookies, as they are obviously not used [Dirk]
- Removed redundant changepwd-button & code from /admin/user.php (Bug #9)
  [Oliver]

  them in All/only one topic/only on homepage like other blocks (feature #326)
  [Oliver]
- A Story can now break over several pages in the body-text. The tag
  [page_break] will split the bodytext in pieces that can be opened with the
  std. COM_printPageNavigation. Introtext is removed for pages>1 [Oliver]
- Added field for old password check in /usersettings.php (bug #230) [Oliver]
- Added password confirmation to /admin/user.php and /usersettings.php
  (bug #230) [Oliver]
- Made the alternating row colors in the Admin's trackback functions compatible
  with the scheme used in other places (list of users, etc.). Also changed the
  list of weblog directory services so that editing is now done by clicking on
  the number of the service [Dirk]
- Stories are no longer forced to be featured _and_ on frontpage (bug #362)
  [Oliver]
- Changed links locations in User-list, added user-photo indicator [Oliver]
- Don't update a story's date any more when unchecking the 'draft' flag

- Fixed inconsistent use of {site_url} and {layout_url} in some of the
  professional theme's admin template files - using {layout_url} everywhere
  now when referring to icons (bug #395) [Dirk]
- Event titles containing quotes were cut off at the first quote in the event
  editor, i.e. both the admin's event editor and the editor for personal events.
  (bug #399) [Dirk]

  some changes to comment.php [Vinny]
- Introduced a 'story.ping' permission that enables users to send Pings,
  Pingbacks, and Trackbacks for a story (or plugin item). Members of the Story
  Admin group have that permission by default.
- Overhauled install script: It will now abort the installation if the minumum
  requirements (PHP 4.1.0, MySQL 3.23.2) are not met. It also displays a warning
  message if register_long_arrays is off (PHP 5 only, bug #360). Another
  warning message is displayed if "public_html" is part of the URL.
  When upgrading, it now tries to identify the Geeklog version that was used

- Fixed date in comment preview (bug #370) [Dirk]
- Incorporated the new syndication framework for reading and writing feeds of
  different formats (RSS, RDF, Atom), provided by Michael Jervis (patch #352).

  Request #67 ("Limiting number of entries in RSS feeds").
  Please note that the feed writer classes, system/classes/*.feed.class.php,
  are now obsolete and can be removed. Please also note this adds new PEAR
  package requirements for Net_URL and HTTP_Request.
- Added support for sending and receiving trackback comments (Feature Request
  #34) Also implemented Pingback support in pretty much the same way. Once
  received, Geeklog treats Trackbacks and Pingbacks the same and stores them
  in the gl_trackback table. [Dirk]
  Both can be switched off in config.php: $_CONF['trackback_enabled'] = false;
  and $_CONF['pingback_enabled'] = false;
- Added a new script, directory.php, that implements a date-based listing of
  all the stories on a site [Dirk]
  A link to the directory is available as a new option, 'directory', for the
  $_CONF['menu_elements'] config variable, so that it can be added to the menu.

  Admin' group will not be checked for spam [Dirk]


July 16, 2006 (1.3.11sr7)
-------------

JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible XSS in the comment handling that we're
fixing with this release.


May 28, 2006 (1.3.11sr6)
------------

The Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran reported the following
security issues:

- Possible SQL injection and authentication bypass in auth.inc.php
- Possible XSS in getimage.php
- Path disclosure in getimage.php and the functions.php of some themes,
  e.g. the Professional theme

An internal code review also revealed a possible SQL injection in story
submissions.


Mar 5, 2006 (1.3.11sr5)
-----------

Security issue:

- Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would allow
  anyone to log in as any user.


Feb 19, 2006 (1.3.11sr4)
------------

Security issues:

- James Bercegay of GulfTech Security Research reported several issues with
  Geeklog's cookie handling that made it vulnerable to SQL injections, arbitrary
  file access, and even injection and execution of arbitrary code.
- Prevent execution of PHP code in "normal" blocks


Dec 12, 2005 (1.3.11sr3)
------------

Security issues:

- Fixed comment bug that allowed comments to be saved even when user did not
  have the correct story/topic permissions (reported by LWC) [Vinny]
- Fixed a path disclosure in case someone tampered with the start date or end
  date in advanced search (reported by r0t3d3Vil) [Mike]
  Feeding malformed dates to the search caused a warning message to be displayed
  that disclosed the path to the Geeklog install on the server. It was NOT
  possible to use this for SQL injections.

Bugfixes:

- Fixed the problems (introduced in 1.3.11sr2) editing static pages when
  $_CONF['url_rewrite'] = true (bug #491) [Dirk]
- The "Reply" button didn't work when viewing individual comments [Vinny]
- Fixed the definition of the 'expire' field (in table gl_stories), which
  caused an SQL error when doing a fresh install on MySQL 5
  (reported by Johannes) [Dirk]

- New Ukrainian language file (Windows-1251), provided by Vitaliy Biliyenko
- New Ukrainian language files (UTF-8 and KOI8-U encoding) for Geeklog, the
  Spam-X, and Static Pages plugins, provided by Yaroslav Fedevych


Oct 9, 2005 (1.3.11sr2)
-----------

This release provides security enhancements and better spam protection
originally developed for Geeklog 1.3.12. It also addresses a few bugs where
the bugfix could be integrated with a reasonable amount of work (other bugfixes
will have to wait for the 1.3.12 release).

Security and Spam protection:

- Added speedlimit to login attempts, defaults to allowing three tries in a
  five minute period.  [Vinny]
  See new config options $_CONF['login_attempts'] and $_CONF['login_speedlimit']
- Changed the spam handling to update the speed limit when spam is detected
  (i.e. handle spam posts as if they were successful posts and make the
  submitter wait for the speed limit to expire). Also send a 403 "Forbidden"
  HTTP response code when displaying the "spam detected" message [Dirk]
  To quote RFC2616: "403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but is
  refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD
  NOT be repeated."
- Filter linefeeds in the To:, From:, and Subject: fields of an email in
  COM_mail [Dirk]
- When a new user account is created and the user submission queue is enabled
  in config.php, ensure that the user is properly "queued" even in the
  unlikely event that the account creation fails halfway through (reported by
  LWC) [Dirk]
- When $_CONF['emailstoryloginrequired'] = 1, hide the links to the "email
  story" form from anonymous users [Dirk]
- When emailing a story, check the user's message that is sent with the story
  for spam [Dirk]
- Added a robots.txt file to the distribution. By default, it excludes
  comment.php, submit.php, and the docs directory from being spidered [Dirk]
- Added a spam check to the user profile [Dirk]
- Story, event, and link submissions are now also checked for spam [Dirk]
- This release also includes the Spam-X plugin version 1.0.2

Please note that MT-Blacklist (used by Spam-X) has recently been discontinued.
For the time being, we provide the last version of the blacklist for download
from geeklog.net (the Spam-X plugin as included in this release is configured
to get it from there for the initial import). There will, however, be no
updates the blacklist. For details, please see
http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued

Bugfixes:

- Fixed an error message thrown up by PHP 5.0.5 or later when viewing the
  article page (bug #483) [Dirk]
- Fixed bug with topic-specific blocks not showing up on the article page when
  URL rewriting was enabled (bug #401) [Dirk]
- Fixed missing site header when trying to submit an event without required
  fields. Also fixed that it would redirect you to the story submission form
  then (bug #409) [Dirk]
- Make sure {menu_elements} is rendered using the menuitem_none.thtml template
  when no menu elements are to be displayed (bug #378) [Dirk]
- Quote names in email addresses as soon as they contain any non-alphanumeric
  characters (apart from the blank). This also addresses bug #368 [Dirk]
- Allow single quotes in passwords (bug #396, also previously reported as
  bug #349 / #996354) [Dirk]
- When $_CONF['profileloginrequired'] was set to 1, the actual message that
  you have to log in before being able to see a user profile was not wrapped
  in the Geeklog framework (reported by Sean C) [Dirk]
- Fix: Made a story's archive/expire date work with the timezone hack [Dirk]
- COM_applyFilter will now accept negative numbers if the isnumeric parameter
  is true. Needed to fix problems with pollbooth.php (and others) [Vinny]
- Upgraded included kses class to version 0.2.2 which fixes problems with
  Japanese and Thai characters (among other things), thus addressing bugs #94
  and #119 [Dirk]
- Fixed SQL error when using the [staticpage:] autotag (bug #373) [Dirk]
- Added a missing stripslashes call to remove backslashes when a topic's name
  was displayed in the index page's title (bug #369) [Dirk]
- Link tags are now translated in printer friendly mode (Bug #411) [Mike]
- Removed the <meta name="ROBOTS"> entry from the Professional theme's
  header.thtml as "INDEX,FOLLOW" is the default anyway. For finer control,
  we now ship a robots.txt [Dirk]

Improvements:

- Don't check for auto-archived stories when no archive topic has been
  defined yet [Dirk]
- Added support for a custom_usercheck function. Custom registration code that
  requires certain information can now abort the creation of a new account if
  that information is missing. The function is called after Geeklog has checked
  that the username and email address of the new user are okay (valid and not
  in the database yet), but before the user has been added to the database
  [Dirk]
- Saved one SQL request for a story's printable view [Dirk]

Language files:

- Made sure all language files refer to Geeklog's [image] tags as [imageX],
  [imageX_right], and [imageX_left] (bug #381) [Dirk]

  Yusuke Sakata


Aug 21, 2005 (Spam-X plugin 1.0.2)
------------

- Changed the display name of the plugin to "Spam-X" to avoid potential
  confusion with the email spam filter of the same name.
  "SpamX" is a registered trademark of Hendrickson Software Components.
- Added a new module to filter posts based on the IP address of the poster
  [Tom Willet]
- Added  a new module to filter posts based on the IP address of the
  spamvertised site [Tom Willet]

- The Spam-X plugin's examine modules run the post through html_entity_decode()
  now in case the spammers try to obfuscate their posts by using HTML entities
  [Tom Willet, Dirk]
- The Mail Admin action module now also reports the HTTP headers of the post
  that triggered the spam filter [Dirk]

be exploited to extract user data such as the user's password hash.


Dec 31, 2004 (1.3.11)
------------

Geeklog 1.3.11 addresses the following security issues:

1. It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions
   were turned off in config.php (reported by Barry Wong).
   These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you
   disabled it in config.php.
2. Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered,
   leaving them open to potential SQL injections.
3. The links for the What's Related block were created from the unfiltered story
   text, opening the possibility of XSS attacks (reported by Vincent Furia).

Bugfixes:

- Added a missing stripslashes() call for the topic name in the What's Related
  block (bug #351) [Dirk]
  (affected file: system/lib-story.php)
- Fixed problems in the story editor when editing plain-text posts with
  uploaded images (bug #356) [Dirk]
  (affected file: public_html/admin/story.php)
- When changing a story ID, update the story ID in any comments to that story,
  too (bug #357) [Dirk]
  (affected file: public_html/admin/story.php)
- Fixed handling of autotags that started with the same substring, e.g. for
  2 tags 'mytag' and 'mytagtwo', the second tag would not be recognized
  (reported by Dr. Shakagee) [Dirk]
  (affected file: system/lib-plugins.php)
- Fixed caching of $_GROUPS [Dirk]
  (affected files: system/lib-security.php, public_html/lib-common.php)
- Made a minor optimization to save one SQL request when displaying the comment
  bar for anonymous users [Dirk]
  (affected file: public_html/lib-common.php)
- Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.
  (affected file: language/slovenian.php)


Dec 22, 2004 (1.3.11rc1)
------------

  stories (bug #345) [Blaine]
- Added missing handling of autotags in static pages being displayed as center
  blocks (reported by Jill) [Dirk]
- Fixed size of the 'sid' field in the gl_comments table. It should be 40
  characters, to be able to hold the long story IDs introduced in 1.3.10
  (reported by Douglas Santos) [Dirk]
- When using mogrify (ImageMagick) to resize uploaded images, the name of the
  image is now enclosed in double quotes instead of single quotes, which
  caused the command to fail on Windows [Dirk]
- The emails sent from the Spam-X plugin's MailAdmin action now also include
  the IP address of the spam poster [Dirk]
- SEC_getFeatureGroup() should not overwrite $_GROUPS if not operating on the
  current user (bug #331) [Dirk]
- Introduced a {camera_icon} variable in story and comment templates that
  displays the little camera icon if the author has uploaded a user photo, just
  like in the Who's Online block (suggested by Laurence Whitworth) [Dirk]
- The parent link in top-level comments took the user to the homepage rather
  than to the article page (bug #346) [Vinny]
- Stories submitted for the archive topic will automatically be saved with
  frontpage = 0 when approved, i.e. only be displayed in the topic [Dirk]
- Avoid emitting an extra <br> tag after the last section in the What's New
  block (bug #330) [Dirk]
- Update comment count in Older Stories block when a new comment is posted
  (bug #317). Also optimized the code to collect the contents of the Older
  Stories block [Dirk]
- Fixed extra <br> being emitted in the calendar for events that aren't
  visible for the current user (bug #268) [Dirk]
- (Event) Admins can now delete events directly from the calendar's day and
  week views (just like events in the personal calendar) [Dirk]
- Fixed usersettings.php so that it displays the "benefits" message again when
  called up by an anonymous user. Also made it go to the user's preferences
  when called without a 'mode' parameter [Dirk]
- Added {layout_url} to the available theme variables in the submission forms.
  Also added {separator} for those who prefer correct spelling ;-) [Dirk]
- More parameter filtering and permission checks in submit.php [Dirk]
- Fixed over-zealous parameter filtering in links.php which prevented
  categories with apostrophes from working [Dirk]
- Fixed broken URLs when editing a plain-text story that contained uploaded
  images (reported by LWC) [Dirk]
- The PEAR classes that ship with Geeklog actually require PHP 4.2.x now.
  However, the missing functions in older PHP versions (minimum requirement
  for Geeklog itself is now PHP 4.1.0) are provided by the PEAR PHP_Compat
  package, which we will have to ship with Geeklog from now on. Added the
  necessary code to lib-common.php to load PHP_Compat, if required [Dirk]
  Many thanks to Tom Willet for providing a test setup.
- Fixed "quick add form" for personal events, so that it stores the new event
  directly now [Dirk]

Nov 28, 2004 (1.3.10)
------------

  autotags. Geeklog will then use the title (of the story / event / static page)
  as the link text [Dirk]
  (affected files: system/lib-plugins.php, plugins/staticpages/functions.inc)

- Updated Chinese language files (all 4 of them), provided by Samuel M. Stone

- When changing a username, make sure to change the name of the user's photo,
  too (bug #321) [Dirk]
- Links in "plain text" stories and comments are now made clickable (i.e.
  enclosed in <a> tags) when the post is saved instead of when it's displayed,
  as in the previous release candidates. This also fixes bug #308. [Dirk]
- Added $_CONF['disable_autolinks'] config option to disable autolinks [Dirk]
- Removed ViewBlacklist.Admin.class.php from the Spam-X plugin [Tom Willet]
- Overhauled handling of personal events [Dirk]:
  + Fixed deleting personal events (again).
  + The upcoming events block now links to the event details of personal
    events (just like it already did for site events).
  + Added stricter checks for permissions, user IDs, and the personal calendars
    being activated in the first place.
- Added a check for allow_url_fopen if reading a (RSS) feed fails and report it
  in error.log if it is off [Dirk]
- When deleting a story (automatically), make sure we're only deleting comments
  belonging to that story (i.e. added a check for type = 'article') [Dirk]

- In the story template files, the number of comments now only is a link when
  there actually is a comment on the story [Dirk]
- Hard-coded the English word 'delete' in the URLs to delete a comment [Dirk]
- For the list of a user's recent comments, use 'mode=view' to link directly
  to a comment now [Dirk]
- Fixed comment id in comment notification emails [Dirk]
- Fixed display of the number of static pages that the user has access to (in
  the Admin Block) [Dirk]
- COM_makeClickableLinks did not recognize links with the 'http:' at the
  start of a line [Dirk]
- Re-introduced <br> between plugin sections in the What's New block, pretty
  much reverting the change suggested by feature request #292 [Dirk]
- Introduced function COM_formatEmailAddress that creates a (more or less)
  RFC(2)822 compliant email address from a name and an address [Dirk]
  This function is now used for formatting the site address, as well as for
  addresses entered by the user in profiles.php and admin/mail.php.
- The Spam-X plugin's MailAdmin action didn't send any email notifications,
  since the call to COM_mail was commented out ... [Dirk]
- admin/mail.php and admin/group.php use the complete URL to the script in
  the <form action="..."> now (instead of relying on PHP_SELF) [Dirk]
- Fixed parse error in the Dutch language file (reported by NeoNecro) [Dirk]
- Allow the dot '.' in IDs (in addition to letters, digits, the dash, and the

Oct 17, 2004 (1.3.10rc1)
------------
- Added new functionality to [autotags] - New plugin API's added  [Blaine]
- Added [autotag] hooks for stories  [Blaine]
- When a plugin had its icon only in the admin directoy, the plugin editor
  did not find it and displayed a generic icon instead [Dirk]
- In admin/mail.php, apply htmlspecialchars() on the email addresses before
  displaying them, as the '<foo@example.com>' part will be interpreted as
  HTML by some browsers (pointed out by LWC) [Dirk]
- When using gdlib for image resizing, GIF images were converted to PNG, but
  Geeklog was still trying to display the GIF (reported by Tom Willet). Since
  the LZW patent has now expired (see http://www.unisys.com/about__unisys/lzw),
  it is safe to use GIF images again, so the PNG conversion was dropped [Dirk]
- Fixed link to the Anonymous user's profile in comment/thread.thtml [Dirk]

  plugin_getmenuitems_xxx (reported by computerade) [Dirk]
- When sending emails from the admin/mail.php, some user's names weren't set
  in their email address (reported by LWC) [Dirk]
- Removed an extra <br> from before and between data provided by plugins in
  the What's New block (feature request #292) [Dirk]
- When creating a new user from admin/user.php, don't determine the uid before
  actually creating the database entries to avoid race conditions / collisions
  with other user accounts created at the same time (bug #243) [Dirk]
  Also took the opportunity to refactor and move the almost identical code
  from users.php and admin/user.php into a new function USER_createAccount in
  system/lib-user.php.
- usersettings.php was missing a default case for unsupported values of 'mode'
  (bug #287). This only displayed a blank page and was not exploitable [Dirk]
- Fixed hard-coded default group names in the Admin sections (e.g. when a user
  had story.edit permissions but was not in the Story Admin group, any new
  story created by that user would default to being owned by the Story Admin
  group nonetheless) [Dirk]
- Introduced new plugin API functions plugin_user_changed_xxx and
  plugin_group_changed_xxx to inform plugins when a user's information
  (profile or settings) or a group (new, edit, delete) has been changed [Dirk]
- COM_checkHTML and COM_allowedHTML now accept an additional parameter in form
  of a comma-separated list of permissions. If the current user has at least
  one of those permissions, they are assumed to be an "Admin" and the functions
  will use the $_CONF['admin_html'] list of HTML tags for them (bugs #114 and
  #118) [Dirk]
- COM_allowedHTML now has an option to only return the list of allowed HTML
  tags without the "Allowed HTML" text (bug #118) [Dirk]
- For the poll block, always use the block title stored in the database (bug
  #205) [Dirk]
- It is now again possible to have a different number of stories per page
  for individual topics. Users have to set their preferred number of stories
  per page to 0 (zero) in their preferences, though, as the user preferences
  will always override this setting (bug #190) [Dirk]
- The Professional theme, kindly provided by Victor B. Gonzalez, is our new
  default theme now.
- In the calendar's day and week view, event permissions weren't checked
  properly, so that some events were displayed to user who shouldn't have
  been able to see them (reported by Willem Jan) [Dirk]
- Don't update a story's hit counter as long as the draft flag is set or the
  publishing date is in the future (feature request #282) [Dirk]
- Introduced new function COM_sanitizeID() to filter special characters out of
  user-editable IDs as used for stories, polls, topics, and static pages (also
  fixes bug #181). Allowed characters are letters a-z (both upper and lower
  case), digits 0-9, the dash '-', and the underscore '_' [Dirk]
- The Upcoming Events block didn't use the help URL, even if it was set
  (reported by Wolfgang M. Schmitt) [Dirk]
- Geeklog now comes with Tom Willet's Spam-X plugin pre-installed. The plugin
  now stores the blacklists in the database and uses a new plugin API
  function to filter comment posts [Tom Willet, Tony, Blaine, Dirk]
- Plugins can now offer their own tags to allow easy linking to their content.
  These tags take the form [name:id link text], where 'name' is a name
  associated with the plugin, 'id' is a unique id referring to one of the
  objects under the plugin's control, and 'link text' is text used in the <a>
  tag that Geeklog creates from these tags.
  Built-in tags are [story:] to link to a story and [event:] to link to an
  event [Blaine, Dirk]
  Example: [story:email-bug About the email bug] would be translated into
  <a href="http://example.com/article.php/email-bug">About the email bug</a>
- portal.php now sends a 301 HTTP status code for the links instead of a 302.
  While a 302 status code would actually make more sense, Google does have a
  tendency to list search results with the URL of the portal script but with
  the content of the linked site, thus giving the impression that the content
  is actually located on another site. Sending a 301 avoids this problem [Dirk]
- Group Admins should not even see the groups of which they are not a member
  (bug #280) [Dirk]
- Prevent Group Admins from listing the members of a group unless they are a
  member of that group themselves [Dirk]
- Introduced $_CONF['left_blocks_in_footer'] config option that makes the
  {left_blocks} variable available in footer.thtml (disabling it in header.thtml
  at the same time). This is really only useful for two-column layouts where
  you want the side blocks in the right column [Dirk]
- Polls linked from the stats page now display the result of the poll instead
  of letting the user vote on them (feature request #267) [Dirk]
- In the Admin's list of events and stories, don't list items for which the
  Admin doesn't have read access (bug #269). [Dirk]
- Story IDs are now editable (just like the IDs of static pages). [Dirk]
  Important: Update the story editor template (admin/story/storyeditor.thtml)!
- Fixed a bug that reset every user's password request as soon as some user
  changed their account information (bug #265) [Dirk]
- Added support for URL rewriting to portal.php [Dirk]
- The links for the What's Related block are stored in the 'related' field in
  the gl_stories table again. Parsing the story for links every time it is
  rendered uses too much CPU power (with apologies to groklaw.net) [Dirk]
- Added theme variable {story_link} to commentbar.thtml to link back to original
  story the comments are derived from. [Vinny]
- Introduced new file system/lib-story.php for story-related functions and
  moved COM_article, COM_whatsRelated, COM_extractLinks, as well as the code
  to delete article images into that file (functions were renamed accordingly:
  STORY_renderArticle, STORY_whatsRelated, STORY_extractLinks) [Dirk]
- Fixed URLs to userphotos and story images when $_CONF['path_images'] had been
  changed (but was still inside of $_CONF['path_html']) [Dirk]
- Added a script to convert an existing database to InnoDB tables (if the MySQL
  version supports them): admin/install/toinnodb.php [Dirk]
- Added missing closing </a> tag in story search results (bug #260) [Dirk]
- Added a second parameter to function COM_makeList that is used as a CSS
  class name in the list it returns (use {list_class_name} to get the actual
  class name, and {list_class} to get class="classname"). Changed the existing
  calls to COM_makeList to include class names, so that you can now use the
  following class names in your stylesheet to style lists: list-feed,
  list-new-comments, list-new-links, list-new-plugins, list-older-stories,
  list-personal-events, list-site-events, list-story-options, list-whats-related
  (the names should be self-explanatory) [Dirk]
- Moved the docs directory to public_html/docs and added a link to it from the
  Admin's block (can be switched off in config.php by setting the new option
  $_CONF['link_documentation'] = 0) [Dirk]
- Replaced 'ppmtojpeg' with 'pnmtojpeg' when using NetPBM for scaling
  uploaded JPEG images (bug #257) [Dirk]
- Added a check (and a warning message) for PHP 4.1.0 to the install script,
  as that is our new minimum requirement [Dirk]
- Rewrote install/success.php and added a link to install/check.php [Dirk]
- Added the 'data' and 'pdfs' directory to install/check.php [Dirk]
- Integrated the "welcome email hack": If the file 'welcome_email.txt' exists
  in the 'data' directory, the contents of that file are sent out as the
  welcome email to new users (instead of the hard-coded welcome message) [Dirk]
- Introduced a 'data' directory ($_CONF['path_data'], defaulting to
  /path/to/geeklog/data) and use it for the batch user import, as Geeklog's
  base directory may not be writable on some setups (bug #77) [Dirk]
- Sort list of older polls by date (newest first) and added paging [Dirk]
- Make sure the old userphoto is deleted when uploading a new one (bug #228).
  So far, the old photo was not removed when the file type changed (e.g. from
  .gif to .jpg) [Dirk]
- Don't assume the uploaded file in usersettings.php is always the userphoto -
  it may in fact belong to a plugin (bug #179). This bug prevented plugins from
  uploading their own files through the plugin API [Dirk]
- Fixed repeating events in the personal calendar's day view (bug #232) [Dirk]
- COM_siteHeader() now accepts a page title (to go between the page's
  <title>...</title> tags) as the second parameter, replacing the
  $_CONF['pagetitle'] hack (which still works but should be avoided) [Dirk]
- In the site's page title, replace the site slogan with more meaningful
  information, where possible, e.g. "Submit a Story" on the story submission
  form, "Search Results", etc. (feature request #95) [Dirk]
- Fixed deleting events from the personal calendar (bug #199) [Dirk]
- Carry over the date and time from the calendar when Admins add a new event
  (bug #132) [Dirk]
- Don't display "Site Events" headline in the Upcoming Events block when
  personal calendars are off (feature request #151) [Dirk]
- Removed hard-coded am/pm formatted hours from the calendar's day view
  (calendar/dayview/dayview.thtml) and replaced them with {xx_hour} variables,
  where 'xx' is 0-23, which will be replaced with the hours formatted
  according to the $_CONF['timeonly'] config variable [Dirk]
- Themes can now use a couple of CSS class names to style the small calendar (of
  the previous and next month) in month view: .smallcal, .smallcal-headline,
  .smallcal-week-even, .smallcal-week-odd, .smallcal-week-empty,
  .smallcal-day-even, .smallcal-day-odd, and .smallcal-day-empty [Dirk]
- Improvements to the Story Archive Feature, UI tweaks, Language Extraction,
  Added new field to the topics table. Admin now sets the archive topic in
  the Topic Editor. Only one topic can be used - logic enforced. [Blaine]
- Don't emit the <br><br> in article.php when the story's body text is empty
  (based on patch #147, provided by Andy Maloney) [Dirk]
- Set {article_url} variable when displaying the story in article.php [Dirk]
- Fixed missing </select> tags for the comment display mode and sort order
  drop-down menus in usersettings.php (patch #255, provided by machinari) [Dirk]
- Hard-coded the names of the pseudo image tags in story.php, i.e. they are
  always [imageX], [imageX_left], and [imageX_right] now, independent of
  the current language file (bug #139) [Dirk]
- Added the Auto-Archive Management feature. Optionally allows the Story Editor
  to archive or delete a story when the expire date is reached [Blaine]
- Improved the commentbar to logically support comments viewed from comment.php
  [Vinny]
- Removed a bug in comment.php that allowed a story/comment mismatch during
  display.  This was not exploitable.  [Vinny]
- Integrated the timezone hack to compensate for time differences when your
  webserver is located in another timezone (original timezone hack by Yew Loong,
  with additions by "Joe" as well as several other geeklog.net users) [Dirk]
- The calendar can now be configured so that the week starts on either a
  Sunday or a Monday - see new config variable $_CONF['week_start']
  (based on a patch by bond_anton) [Dirk]
- Sort the admin's list of events by date (newest first). Also added paging,
  a row number and parameter filtering. Paging and the row number require
  theme changes in admin/event/eventlist.thtml and listitem.thtml [Dirk]
- Incorporated a patch provided by Drago Goricanec to sort the Admin's user
  list by uid [Dirk]
- Introduced 2 config options for the Who's Online block:
  - $_CONF['whosonline_fullname'] will display the user's full name,
  - $_CONF['whosonline_anonymous'] does not display the names of registered
    users to anonymous visitors of the site.
  Both options are disabled by default [Dirk]
- Added support for single quotes and nested tags to COM_extractLinks [Vinny]
- The admin_html and user_html are now merged recursively (bug #240) [Vinny]
- Remove colons from email addresses, as they have a special meaning,
  according to RFC(2)822, that we didn't intend (bug #6) [Dirk]
- Fixed compilation of regexp if the search query ended or started with a
  space (the resulting error message would also expose the path to article.php),
  (bug #251) [Dirk]
- Sort the admin's list of polls by date (newest first). Also added paging,
  a row number and parameter filtering. Paging and the row number require
  theme changes in admin/poll/polllist.thtml and listitem.thtml [Dirk]
- Added paging to the plugin editor (for more than 25 installed plugins).
  A {google_paging} variable is needed in admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml for
  the paging links to show up [Dirk]
- Emails sent from the Admin's mail form (admin/mail.php) were always sent
  with the site name and site email address, even if you entered something else
  in the form. Also made admin/mail/mailform.thtml slightly less ugly [Dirk]
- When deleting a topic, keep the blocks assigned to that topic (bug #247).
  They're assigned to 'all topics' and disabled, but kept around now. The same
  applies for topic feeds, which weren't handled at all before [Dirk]
- Make sure upload errors for user photos and story images are displayed in a
  Geeklog block, not on a blank screen [Dirk]
- Fixed description of DB_insertId() in lib-database.php and dbInsertId() in
  mysql.class.php: The functions take a resource, describing the opened link to
  the database, not a record set (pointed out by lgonze on IRC). [Dirk]
- Plugins are now getting the key type passed to their search function, so that
  they can perform a search for "exact phrase", "all of these words", or
  "any of these words" as selected from the search form. [Dirk]
- Use URL rewriting for the link to a story's printer-friendly version, when
  activated (bug #201) [Dirk]
- Resizing an image didn't work when the image height exceeded the max. height
  but the image width was still below the max. width (bug #242) [Dirk]
- Keeping the unscaled image when using GDlib didn't work (bug #197) [Dirk]
- Added a workaround for the Zeus webserver so that blocks marked "homeonly"
  properly appear there (bug #244) [Dirk]
- Previewing a story submission from admin/story.php before saving it left the
  original story submission in the submission queue while also adding it as a
  new story. This has been fixed now [Dirk]
- Added {article_url} variable for article/printable.thtml so that we can
  print the proper URL to the article if URL rewriting is on [Dirk]
- Added filtering for the $order parameter in article.php [Dirk]
- Added {link_actual_url} variable in links.php, holding the actual URL of
  a link (not Geeklog's redirect URL via portal.php). Updated template
  file links/linkdetails.thtml in all default themes to use {link_actual_url}
  in a title attribute for the links [Dirk]
- The event description now honors linefeeds to allow some basic text
  formatting [Dirk]
- Escape all PCRE special characters in the code to highlight search query
  words (bug #200). Also moved the code to its own function, COM_highlightQuery,
  in lib-common.php [Dirk]
- The contents and order of the menu entries, i.e. of the {menu_elements}
  variable in header.thtml, is now configurable in config.php (new config
  variable $_CONF['menu_elements']). It also includes an option to add custom
  entries by implementing a function CUSTOM_menuEntries() that returns the
  additional entries [Dirk]
- Use an UPDATE request when increasing the number of times a story has been
  emailed [Dirk]
- When an error occurs while creating a backup, the complete command line
  used to call mysqldump is now added to error.log [Dirk]
- Added 'view' mode to allow links directly to a single comment (and optionally
  its children) in comments.php.  [Vinny]
- Added a few variables to be used in the eventdetails.thtml template file:
  {event_state_name} (full name of the state), {event_state_only} and
  {event_state_name_only} (abbreviated and full state name without the comma),
  {event_edit} (link to edit the event, if allowed for the current user),
  {edit_icon} (same, but with the edit icon instead of a text link),
  {lang_event_type} and {event_type} for the event type [Dirk]
- Registered users can now report abusive comments to the site admin (inspired
  by Feature Request #171, which actually requested this for the forums).
  Requires new text strings in the language files and a new template file,
  comment/reportcomment.thtml [Dirk]
- Bugfix: New users created through the batch import didn't get the email with
  their password [Dirk]
- Moved function to create and send a password to lib-user.php to avoid having
  identical code in users.php, admin/user.php, and admin/moderation.php [Dirk]
- Added {topic_image} variable (available in the topicoption.thtml and
  topicoption_off.thtml template files) so that you can use topic images in
  the Topics block (feature request #152) [Dirk]
- COM_undoSpecialChars() now also handles &nbsp; (bug #192) [Dirk]
- Fixed handling of HTML entities in [code] sections (bug #159) [Dirk]
- Added an option to look up IP addresses (new variable $_CONF['ip_lookup'] in
  config.php, pointing to a service that does IP address lookups) [Dirk]
- Fixed problems with the database backup when there were spaces in the path to
  the backups directory (bug #185). [Dirk]
- Added email notification for new comments (feature request #155) [Dirk]
- Added tracking of IP addresses of comment posters (as suggested by Michael
  Jervis) [Dirk]
- Altered COM_article to improve performance by reducing queries. [Vinny]
- Reduced DB queries in COM_showTopics to improve performance. [Vinny]
- Cached enabled plugins to reduce db queries and improve performance. [Vinny]
- Fixed SEC_inGroup not using $_GROUPS cache in several instances. [Vinny]
- mysql.class.php now only runs mysql_connect once per page load.  [Vinny]
- The "Google paging" now has additional links to jump to the first and last
  page (patch provided by Niels Leenheer). [Dirk]
- Introduced function COM_makeClickableLinks to turn URLs in text-only posts
  into clickable links (i.e. it's adding <a> tags around URLs). [Dirk]
- Changed the comment insert, delete, display algorithms for improved
  efficiency. They now use a modified preorder tree traversal method. [Vinny]
- Comment limit now applies to all the comments displayed, not just the top
  level comments. [Vinny]
- Added pagination ability to comments ({pagenav} template variable in
  startcomment.thtml). [Vinny]
- Fixed typo in timer.class.php that broke the ->restart() function. [Vinny]
- Make sure the database backup files are always sorted by (last modified) date
  (found & fixed by Alexander Schmacks). [Dirk]
- Make sure the user's preferred comment limit is used when changing the
  comment display via the comment bar (bug #176). [Vinny]
- When URL rewriting is activated, the "rewritten" URLs are now also used
  in all (RSS) feeds containing links to articles. [Dirk]
- Experimental: On a fresh install, use InnoDB tables (instead of MyISAM) if
  the MySQL version running on the server supports them (usually as of
  MySQL 4.0). This should avoid locks on tables where hit counters and the
  actual data are stored in the same table, e.g. stories (suggested by
  Marc Von Ahn). [Dirk]
- Fixed bug in the install script when upgrading from 1.3.8 or earlier:
  Check to see if the static pages plugin is installed before attempting to
  update its tables (reported by Rob Griffiths). [Dirk]
- Implemented a change to DB_fetchArray, suggested by Niels Leenheer:
  Geeklog will now, by default, only return associative array indices. In case
  the numeric indices are needed, a new (optional) second parameter for
  DB_fetchArray has to be set to "true". [Dirk]
- Removed extra quotes in SQL statements in admin/block.php to ensure
  compatibility with old MySQL versions (reported by Elmer Masters). [Dirk]
- In admin/database.php, if the is_executable function is not available (e.g.
  on Windows), do at least a file_exists to check if the mysqldump executable
  exists in the path given in config.php. [Dirk]
- Introduced function COM_getTopicSQL which returns part of an SQL request to
  check for a user's topic access [Dirk]
  (This was actually introduced in 1.3.9sr1 but missing from the changelog)

Language files
--------------
- New Bosnian language file, provided by Kenan Hodzic
- Updated Croatian language file, provided by Roberto Bilic
- New Indonesian language file, provided by Piotr Sobis
- Updated Norwegian language file, provided by Torfinn Ingolfsen

Static Pages Plugin 1.4.1
-------------------------
- Added a printable version for static pages (based on a concept by
  Jannetta S Lewis). Requires a new template file, printable.thtml, located
  in the static pages' template directory [Dirk]
- Added support for autolinks and provide a [staticpage:] autotag [Dirk]
- Added an option to sort the static pages that are added to a site's menu
  (see {plg_menu_elements} in header.thtml) by id, label, title, or date [Dirk]
- The block templates used to wrap a static page in a block can now be
  overridden, using '_staticpages_block' and '_staticpages_centerblock' as the
  index for the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE array [Dirk]
- The plugin now checks for template files in the current theme's directory
  (layout/THEMENAME/staticpages) first before using the default template files
  from plugin/staticpages/templates [Dirk]
- When displaying a static page, the plugin no longer checks if the current
  user is a member of the Root group, so that "Root" users shouldn't see static
  pages that are for anonymous users only [Dirk]
  This change was actually supposed to be in Static Pages 1.4 (Geeklog 1.3.9),
  but somehow didn't make it ...
- For center blocks, ignore the "blank page" setting, unless it's for a page
  that is supposed to replace the entire frontpage (bug #234) [Dirk]
- The static pages editor doesn't display a "delete" button for new and
  cloned pages any more (since, obviously, you can't delete what hasn't been
  saved yet ...). [Dirk]
- Bugfix: Fresh installs of Geeklog 1.3.9 only allowed 20 characters for the
  static page ID, while installs upgraded from an earlier version allowed up
  to 40 characters [Dirk]
- New Portuguese (Brazil) language file, provided by Alcides Soares Filho.


Mar 5, 2006 (1.3.9sr5)
-----------

This release addresses the following security issues:

- Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would allow
  anyone to log in as any user.
- James Bercegay of GulfTech Security Research reported several issues with
  Geeklog's cookie handling that made it vulnerable to SQL injections, arbitrary
  file access, and even injection and execution of arbitrary code.
- Prevent execution of PHP code in "normal" blocks


Jul 3, 2005 (1.3.9sr4)
-----------

This release addresses the following security issue:

Stefan Esser found an SQL injection that can, under certain circumstances,
be exploited to extract user data such as the user's password hash.


Dec 31, 2004 (1.3.9sr3)
------------

This release addresses 2 security issues:

1. It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions
   were turned off in config.php (reported by Barry Wong).
   These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you
   disabled it in config.php.
2. Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered,
   leaving them open to potential SQL injections.


Oct 8, 2004 (1.3.9sr2)
-----------

This release addresses 2 security issues:

- Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the $topic
  variable in the language files ($LANG05[3]) where it should have been
  using '%s' instead (bug #293) [Vinny, Dirk]
- It was possible to post comments to stories or polls for which comment
  posting had been switched off [Dirk]
  This was only a problem if you allowed anonymous posts or when spammers
  went through the trouble of actually signing up for an account before
  posting.

Non-security related fixes:

- Fixed lib-plugins.php to be compatible with PHP 5 [Dirk]
- Includes updated PEAR packages to resolve email problems some users were
  having (especially with safe_mode being on).


Jun 1, 2004 (1.3.9sr1)
-----------

This release addresses the following security issues:

- It was possible to post anonymous comments, even when anonymous comment
  posting had been switched off in config.php [Vinny, Dirk]
- Added additional speed limit checks for comments and submissions [Vinny]
- It was still possible to read the comments to stories, even when the user
  didn't have access to the story's topic (provided they knew the story id)
  [Vinny, Dirk]
- If none of the topics were visible for anonymous users, the site's index
  page may still have displayed some stories for anonymous users, depending on
  the stories' permissions [Vinny, Dirk]
- Users still got Daily Digest emails for topics from which they had been
  removed (bug #178) [Dirk]
- It was possible to subscribe to the Daily Digest for all topics, even if the
  user did not have access to certain topics [Dirk]
- Don't list stories or comments in the user profile if the current user isn't
  allowed to see the topics they were posted under (bug #208) [Dirk]

Non-security related fixes:

- Fixed an SQL error in COM_showTopics if users excluded topics in their
  preferences (reported by Rob Young) [Dirk]
- Fixed sporadic "Duplicate entry '...' for key 1." messages in error.log
  (caused by the handling of pseudo-session ids for anonymous users) [Dirk]
- Fixed incorrect author names in Daily Digest (bug #207) [Dirk]
- The plugin_profileblocksedit_<plugin-name> Plugin API function wasn't working
  due to a missing piece of code in usersettings.php [Dirk]
- COM_extractLinks will now ignore anchor tags that do not contain "href"
  (bug #183) [Vinny]


Mar 14, 2004 (1.3.9)
------------

- Custom Registration function hook to custom_useredit added in the edituser()
  when creating a new user from the admin screen. The custom function was not
  being called if this was a new user [file: admin/user.php].
- Fixed wrong use of DB_count in COM_showPoll in lib-common.php. This may have
  prevented people from voting on other polls once they voted on any poll on
  a site [file: lib-common.php].

- Updated Danish language file, provided by ZooN.
- Updated Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel (please note that this
  file was made for 1.3.8-1 and is missing a few of the texts added in 1.3.9).


Mar 7, 2004 (1.3.9rc3)
-----------

- Fixed call to CUSTOM_mail and added a sample implementation in
  lib-custom.php (commented out by default).
- Made an attempt to recover from duplicate session ids for anonymous users.
- Adding new topics always resulted in a "Please fill in the Topic ID and Topic
  Name fields" error message, even if you did fill in both fields (this bug was
  only introduced in 1.3.9rc2).
- Filter out backslashes.
- Comment titles were cut off at the first single or double quote (when
  submitting a new comment).
- The text string $LANG04[89] in all language files must be enclosed in
  double quotes, not single quotes.

- Updated Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel.
- Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik.
- Updated Polish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by
  Robert Stadnik
- Updated Russian language file, provided by Denis Kuznetsov.
- Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.
- Included UTF-8 versions of the Croatian and Japanese language files,
  provided by Samuel Stone.


Feb 29, 2004 (1.3.9rc2)
------------

- The new Admin interface for handling blocks (introduced in 1.3.9rc1) will
  renumber the block order in steps of 10, which can lead to order numbers
  > 255 if you have many blocks. Changed the 'blockorder' field in the
  "gl_blocks" table from TINYINT to SMALLINT to compensate.
  If you are upgrading from 1.3.9rc1, you will need to run the following SQL
  request manually:

      ALTER TABLE gl_blocks CHANGE blockorder blockorder smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default '1';

  Replacing "gl_blocks" with the proper table name, if you are using a table
  prefix other than 'gl_'. This step is not necessary when upgrading from 1.3.8
  or earlier versions.
- The Group Admin restrictions introduced in 1.3.9rc1 didn't even let the
  Admin assign unassigned features to groups (e.g. there was no way to add
  the staticpages.PHP feature to the Static Page Admin group on a fresh
  1.3.9rc1 install).
- When normal users tried to submit an event, they were redirected to the
  story submission form (this bug was only introduced in 1.3.9rc1).
- Cosmetic changes in the beautifying of language names (in the user's
  preferences).
- Fixed COM_extractLinks to work with links that follow [IMAGE] tags and more
  generally handle the extraction of links better and more efficiently.
- If a function CUSTOM_mail() exists, it will be called instead of COM_mail(),
  to allow users to implement their own function to send emails, if necessary.
- The Static Pages plugin now supports the "exact phrase", "all of these words",
  and "any of these words" search options.
- Included a simplified custom registration example and made the naming
  convention for the custom registration functions more consistent.
- Fixed display problems with comments in nested and threaded mode.
  Please note that the template file comment/comment.thtml has changed (again)
  since 1.3.9rc1!
- Don't rely on the Who's Online block being active when handling sessions
  for anonymous users.
- Removed some unused code that handled the obsolete "layout" blocks.
- Try to guess the correct path separator when running on PHP < 4.3.0.
- When upgrading from a pre-1.3.9 install, the install script choked on
  single quotes in the site name or site slogan.
- More parameter filtering.

- Included UTF-8 versions of the English, German, Finnish, and Chinese
  (traditional and simplified) language files, provided by Samuel Stone.
- Added new Croatian language file, provided by Roberto Bilic.
- Added new Finnish language file, provided by Jussi Josefsson.
- Added new Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel.
- Updated Dutch language file, provided by Wim Niemans.


Feb 16, 2004 (1.3.9rc1)
------------

- Use COM_getYearFormOptions() etc. for the event submission form in
  submit.php, thus avoiding duplicated code.
- Plugins can now add their new entries to the What's New block by implementing
  the new plugin_whatsnewsupported and plugin_getwhatsnew API functions.
  This section can be enabled/disabled with the new $_CONF['hidenewplugins']
  config variable.
- When a user is deleted, make sure we assign any objects that require Admin
  access (blocks, topics, ...) to a user from the Root group.
- Slightly revamped the install script and made it catch (or silently ignore)
  the most popular problems with the path to Geeklog ...
- Removed the hard-coded &nbsp; from {welcome_msg} and added it to the
  header.thtml of the Classic, XSilver, and Yahoo themes (the other themes
  either look fine without it or didn't use {welcome_msg} anyway).
- Added a missing stripslashes() call for link titles returned from a search.
- Fixed bug when highlighting search queries that contained a '*' (reported
  by wlparks).
- Fixed a bug/typo introduced in 1.3.8-1sr4 that prevented you from deleting
  story submissions from the Admin's story editor (reported by James Bothe).
- Changed all url fields in the database to hold up to 255 characters per URL.
  Please note that the template files in most themes will limit the max.
  number of characters to 96 or 128 characters. See docs/theme.html for more
  information on how to update the themes.
- Fixed problems batch-importing users with single quotes in their names
  (bug #141).
- The permissions for the "Group Admin" group have been changed such that
  members of that group now only have access to groups of which they themselves
  are a member of. When creating new groups, the rights (permissions) to chose
  from are also limited to those that the Group Admin users have themselves.
  These changes should make the Group Admin group more useful.
  Note: Group admins can still see all the existing groups and who is a member
  of those groups.
- Fixed search class so that the simplified and the advanced search return
  the same results (as long as none of the advanced options are used).
- Added new config variable $_CONF['allowed_protocols'] which lets you specify
  the protocols that are allowed to be used in a link (feature request #109).
  Note: The kses class has a hard-coded list of allowed protocols to which
  the above will be added. It is currently not possible to remove any of the
  predefined protocols.
- Introduced variable {allowed_menu_elements} in header.thtml which only
  includes those menu elements that the current user is allowed to use
  (i.e. honoring the $_CONF['XXXloginrequired'] settings).
- COM_accessLog() now logs the user's uid and IP address automatically.
- The option to stay logged in for 1 year has been removed and an option to
  not stay logged in (after the session has expired) has been added.
- Fixed display of default blocks in the user preferences.
- If the user chose not to see certain topics (by selecting them from the
  "Excluded Items" list in the preferences) then don't list those topics in
  the Topics block.
- After saving your account information, you are now redirected to your
  profile page, so that you can see your changes as they would be displayed
  for other users of the site.
- Integrated Vincent Furia's patches to use Geeklog's URL rewriting for links
  to stories (i.e. article.php).
- In the story templates, you can now use {article_url} as the URL to the
  article.php with the current story (e.g. for a "link to this story" link).
- There is a new file, system/lib-user.php, for user-related code that is
  used by usersettings.php, admin/user.php, and admin/moderation.php.
- All template files that let you enter a URL are now using {max_url_length}
  for the maxlength attribute.
- Access to admin/mail.php is now granted to all users with 'user.mail'
  permissions (previously, users with that permission without being in the
  'Mail Admin' group would see the "Mail Users" entry in the Admin block but
  were refused access to it).
- The list of group names in the Mail Users form is now sorted alphabetically.
- Any unauthorized attempts to access the admin pages are now properly logged
  in access.log.
- Fixed problems when resizing userphotos for user names that have spaces in
  them (reported by Per on geeklog-users).
- Now accomodate strict webhosts who don't allow file uploads to the standard
  image directory, you can now set a new configuration variable,
  $_CONF['path_images'] to point to a directory outside of your webtree where
  article images and user profile pictures will be saved and served from.
- Don't append a '-' to the page title if $_CONF['site_slogan'] is empty
  (feature request #88).
- COM_getMonthFormOptions() now always lists the month names instead of only
  the numbers. COM_getYearFormOptions() also lists the previous year.
- Changed admin/event.php to use the COM_getMonthFormOptions() etc. functions
  from lib-common.php, thus avoiding duplicated code.
- In the calendar/calendar.thtml template file, you can now use {start_block}
  and {end_block} to wrap the calendar in a block.
- Fixed a few display problems in case of errors in calendar_event.php. Also
  made calendar.php display messages sent from calendar_event.php.
- Make sure the custom registration form is properly called from all relevent
  places (bug #57).
- Single quotes are now silently stripped from topic IDs (bug #113).
- Fixed search displaying all the links for an empty search string, e.g. when
  searching for "more from" some user (bug #87).
- Fixed link from search results that contained a '/' (bug #115).
- Comments from a story that has been marked as "draft" are no longer returned
  from a search (bug #128).
- The Admin's link list now uses "google paging", 50 links per page (bug #104).
  Note: Requires a change in the admin/link/linklist.thtml template file.
- (Block)Admins can now change the order of blocks and enable / disable blocks
  directly from the Admin's list of blocks (based on a concept by stratosfear).
- An alternative interface to adding (multiple) users to a group is now
  available from the Admin's list of groups. This feature requires JavaScript.
- Fixed display of permissions in the "Access" column of the Admin's list of
  stories (didn't take Topic permissions into account).
- Fixed handling of "0" as a poll answer (bug #73).
- Added a check and warning message in admin/moderation.php if register_globals
  is "off".
- Changed function COM_isEmail() to use PEAR::Mail/RFC822 to check for valid
  email addresses.
- Added an edit icon to each theme (images/edit.gif). Variable {edit_icon} can
  be used as an alternative to {edit_link}, i.e. as an icon that Story Admins
  can click on to edit a story.
- You can now enable debug messages (to error.log) for the image upload by
  setting $_CONF['debug_image_upload'] = true in config.php.
- When deleting a group, delete all references to that group from the
  group_assignments table (bug #50). The install script will remove any
  orphaned entries when upgrading the database to 1.3.9.
- The option to delete comments was only available to users in the Root group
  (e.g. Admin). Since comments don't have permissions, comments can now be
  deleted by users with Story Admin permissions for the story they are
  commenting on (or Poll Admin permissions for comments on polls; bug #27).
- Display a generic (and localised) error message when there is a problem
  importing an (RSS) feed - details will be available in error.log. Also checks
  for empty (but existing) feeds now.
- When the user submission queue is activated, you now have an "edit" link
  that takes you to the Admin's user editor (the profile link is now on the
  username). Contributed by Ed Magin.
- COM_siteHeader() now uses output buffering for the eval(), preventing the
  header from being output directly.
  Note: This may require changes in 3rd party scripts, e.g. the Geeklog/Gallery
  integration.
- The install script will set the 'date' field for links to sensible values
  now (reconstructed from the date that's encoded in the link id).
- The author exclusion list in the preferences is now a (multi-select) listbox.
- A proper error message is now displayed if the Admin creates a new user or
  changes an existing account with an email address that already exists (that
  test was already introduced in 1.3.8-1 but the error message was confusing),
  thus closing bug #24. Also checks for valid email addresses now.
- You can now use {author_fullname} and {author_photo} variables in comment
  templates (feature request #35).
- Remove extra backslashes from new links in What's New block (bug #59).
- The [code] tag is now displayed in the list of allowed HTML tags.
- Image upload can now use the GD library (contributed by Rob Coenen).
  If possible, GIF images will be converted to PNGs during upload. However,
  some versions of the GD library may not allow to read GIF images at all.
- Geeklog now uses PEAR::Mail to send all emails.
  In config.php, you can select whether emails should be sent via PHP's mail()
  function, sendmail, or SMTP.
- Introduced /path/to/geeklog/system/pear as the directory to hold the PEAR
  packages used by Geeklog. Currently, those are PEAR, Mail, Net_SMTP, and
  Net_Socket. These packages will be included in the releases from now on.
- Introduced function COM_mail(). From now on, all Geeklog email will be sent
  from this function (instead of using PHP's mail() function directly).
- When users try to register with an empty username or invalid email address,
  make sure we're displaying a custom registration form (if one exists) when
  displaying the error message (part 1 of bug #57).
- Prevent users from registering with an empty username (bug #56).
- Use $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault'] when batch-adding users. Until now,
  new users were subscribed to the Daily Digest automatically (bug #55).
- Added an 'edit' link to links/linkdetails.thtml, so that (Link) Admins can
  edit links easily (contributed by Euan McKay).
- What's Related applied COM_checkHTML() on the entire block instead of on the
  individual items, thus stripping out HTML from the template file (bug #52).
- Words from a search query are now properly highlighted in comments when the
  words occured only in the comments (but not in the story).
- Integrated Vincent Furia's new comment code to use templates for comments
  (instead of hard-coded HTML).
  New template files: comment/comment.thtml, comment/thread.thtml.
  Updated: comment/startcomment.thtml
- New Admin interface for content syndication (RSS feeds etc.). This lets you
  create feeds for all the stories and per topic as well as for links and
  (upcoming) events. Plugins can also provide feeds (through extensions of the
  Plugin API). Additional feed formats (other than RSS 0.91) can be implemented
  as new classes (xxx.feed.class.php).
  Includes new admin/syndication template directory.
- Don't display the "delete" button in the Admin's Event editor when we're
  editing a new event (reported by Simon Lord).

Static Pages Plugin 1.4
-----------------------

- It is now possible to disable the use of PHP in static pages entirely by
  setting $_SP_CONF['allow_php'] = 0 in the static pages' config.php file.
  If you don't plan on using PHP in static pages, it is recommended that you
  do that as an additional security measure.
- You can now use "plain PHP" code in a static page, i.e. it doesn't need to
  be written such that it returns all output in a 'return' statement. The
  PHP checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown menu offering "do not execute
  PHP", "execute PHP (return)" [that's the old way], and "execute PHP" [new].
- The ID of a static page can now have up to 40 characters.
- When displaying a static page, the plugin no longer checks if the current
  user is a member of the Root group, so that "Root" users shouldn't see static
  pages that are for anonymous users only.
- The option to wrap static pages in a block can now be applied to each page
  individually. $_SP_CONF['in_block'] is only used as the default setting
  for new pages.
- Static pages to be displayed after the featured story (in a center block) are
  now displayed even if there is no featured story (after the static pages to
  be displayed at the top of the page).
- Static pages are not wrapped in a block when the page format is set to "blank
  page" (bug #60).
- Added a "Cancel" button in the static pages editor.
- Bugfix: Depending on the permission settings, the "Edit" link was sometimes
  displayed for users without them having edit permissions for the static page.
  It wasn't possible to edit the page, though, but the link shouldn't have
  been there in the first place.
- For security reasons, the Static Page Admin group does not include
  'staticpages.PHP' permissions by default any more.
- When a user is deleted, static pages created by that user can now either be
  deleted or assigned to a Root user (see $_SP_CONF['delete_pages'] option).

Please see docs/staticpages.html for details.


Oct 8, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr6)
-----------

This release addresses 2 security issues:

- Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the $topic
  variable in the language files ($LANG05[3]) where it should have been
  using '%s' instead (bug #293) [Vinny, Dirk]
  Note: german.php was not affected and is therefore not included.

- It was possible to post comments to stories or polls for which comment
  posting had been switched off [Dirk]
  This was only a problem if you allowed anonymous posts or when spammers
  went through the trouble of actually signing up for an account before
  posting.


Jun 1, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr5)
-----------

This release fixes a bug due to which it was possible to post anonymous
comments even when anonymous comment posting had been switched off in
config.php.

To upgrade from Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr4 to 1.3.8-1sr5, simply upload the included
comment.php, replacing the file of the same name on your webserver.


January 26, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr4)
----------------

This release addresses the following security issues:

1. It was possible for users in the Group Admin and User Admin groups to
   become a member of the Root group (reported by Samuel M. Stone, bug #135).
2. Being admin for a certain area (e.g. Story Admin for stories) made it
   possible to delete all objects in that area (e.g. stories) even if the
   user was not supposed to have access to them, provided the id of the object
   was known.
3. It was possible to delete other people's personal events if you knew the
   event ID.
4. It was possible to browse through the comments of a story even if the user
   did not have access to the actual story (reported by Peter Roozemaal).
5. Due to an XSS issue, it was possible to change someone's account settings
   (including the password) if you got them to click on a specially crafted
   link (reported by Jelmer, fix suggested by Vincent Furia).
6. The comment display suffered from the possibility of an SQL injection
   (reported by Jelmer).
7. It was possible to inject Javascript code in the calendar (reported by
   Jelmer).
8. It was possible to execute (but not save) Javascript code in the comment
   preview (reported by Jelmer).


December 5, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr3)
----------------

This release addresses the following security-related issues:

1. As "dr.wh0" pointed out, the category field for link submissions was not
   filtered at all. Although you probably can't cause too much harm with
   those 32 characters, this has now been fixed.
2. Vincent Furia found that the restrictions for the form to email users
   could be circumvented and could even be used to spam users.
   In addition to fixing theses issues, there is now also a speed limit
   on that form (defaults to the speed limit for story submissions).
3. There was a way to post comments anonymously even when posting for
   anonymous users had been disabled.
4. It was possible to post comments under someone else's username.


October 14, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr2)
----------------

Jouko Pynnonen found a way to trick the new "forgot password" feature,
introduced in 1.3.8, into letting an attacker change the password for _any_
account. This release addresses this issue - there were no other changes.

The only thing you need to do is to replace the file users.php on your site
with the file that comes with this tarball. It's suggested that you change
the version number in your config.php to '1.3.8-1sr2' afterwards.

Please note that only Geeklog 1.3.8, 1.3.8-1, and 1.3.8-1sr1 are affected,
as this feature did not exist in earlier versions.


October 12, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr1)
----------------

This release is intended to address some of the security issues reported in
September and early October 2003.

1. Includes Ulf Harnhammar's kses HTML filter to address possible Javascript
   injections and CSS defacements.

   When upgrading from an earlier version, please make sure to copy over the
   $_CONF['user_html'] and $_CONF['admin_html'] arrays from the included
   config.php to your own copy of that file.

2. While almost all of the alleged SQL injection issues could not be
   reproduced, this release includes an update to the MySQL class to not
   report SQL errors in the browser any more (but only in Geeklog's error.log).
   This will avoid disclosing any sensitive information as part of the error
   message.

   Please note that at the moment we do NOT recommend to use Geeklog with
   MySQL 4.1 (which, at the time of this writing, is in alpha state and should
   not be used on production sites anyway).

   An upcoming release of Geeklog will address the remaining SQL issues,
   including any problems with MySQL 4.1.

Other fixes (not security-related):
- When trying to guess the value of $_CONF['cookiedomain'], we need to remove
  the port number from the URL, if there is one (bug #75).
- The full 1.3.8-1sr1 tarball also includes updated French (Canada) and
  Turkish language files.


August 9, 2003 (1.3.8-1)
--------------

- When upgrading, the install script will now default the version selection to
  the last version in the list (currently: 1.3.7) instead of the first one
  (1.2.5-1).
- Don't allow HTML in static page titles (bug #26).
- Display the search form again if the query returned no results.
- Make sure we're not attempting to send a Daily Digest email to Anonymous.
- Prevent admin from changing a user's email address to one that's already used
  by someone else (bug #24). The error message you get when you try this may
  be confusing, though ("The username you tried saving already exists.") since
  I don't want to introduce new texts in the language file at this point. To
  be corrected later.
- Fixed a problem with the cookie timeout: When a user edited his/her profile
  for the first time, the cookie timeout defaulted to 1 hour, while the default
  in config.php was usually much longer (default: 1 week). So after editing
  their profile for the first time, users didn't stay logged in as long as
  before (unless they noticed that and changed the cookie timeout accordingly
  themselves).
- Fixed problems in the install script when trying to find out the MySQL
  version number.
- Fixed a problem collecting links for the What's Related block when the article
  contained (uploaded) images.
- Words from a search query are now hightlighted in comments as well.
- You can now use variables {rss_url} and {rdf_file} in both the site header
  and footer. Both variables hold the URL to the RSS feed.
- Fixed an occassional "call to member function of non-object" error message
  in lib-plugins.php.
- Make sure the RSS feed and Older Stories block are updated when a story is
  deleted.
- The language selection will only list files that end in .php and do not
  start with a '.'.
- Fixed links to a user's comments from the Last 10 Comments block in the user
  profile.
- Removed '&query=' from links in search results if the query was empty.
- Anonymous users couldn't use the advanced search even if
  $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] was not set.
- Fix to disallow access to the extended search for anonymous users (i.e.
  $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] works again as it did in 1.3.7)
- Fixed search by date.
- Template variable {uid_value} was always empty in the user's profile edit
  form (in usersettings.php).

- New French (Canada) language file, provided by Jean-Francois Allard.
- Updated Dutch language file, provided by W. Niemans.
- Updated Bulgarian language file, provided by Vassil Simeonov and Itso Banov.
- Updated Spanish language file, provided by Angel Romero.

- New French (Canada) language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by
  Jean-Francois Allard.
- New Dutch language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by W. Niemans.


July 17, 2003 (1.3.8)
-------------

- Added Blaine's sample code for the custom registration to lib-custom.php
  (there's also an accompanying sample template file, memberdetail.thtml).
- "No new links" wasn't displayed in the What's New block when you didn't
  have any links in the database or when the current user didn't have access
  to any of them (reported by krove).
- Applied a patch by Tatsumi Imai to fix problems with Japanese characters
  when editing polls (bug #17).
- Hide those story submissions from moderators that don't have access to the
  topic.
- Use $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['PATH_INFO'] instead of $PATH_INFO for the url_rewrite
  feature, since the latter doesn't seem to work on some setups (reported by
  Peter Sieradzki).

- Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.
- Updated Polish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by
  Robert Stadnik


July 6, 2003 (1.3.8rc2)
------------

- When failing to delete an image for a story (from the Admin's story editor),
  only log this problem in the error.log but don't abort the script (reported
  by Rob).
- When editing a story that used double quotes in the title, the title was cut
  off after the first quote sign.
- Story Admins could edit stories in a topic they didn't have access to, if
  they somehow found out the story id.
- When $_CONF['listdraftstories'] was enabled, moderation.php listed all stories
  that had the "draft" flag set without checking for topic permissions (this
  option was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1).
- For Story Admins, the Admin menu may have listed a greater number of stories
  than the user actually had access to (didn't check for topic permissions).
- Fixed "Google paging" on the Admin's list of stories when the current user
  didn't have access to all the topics (paging was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1).
- Try to prevent "illegal access" messages in error.log, caused by the plugin
  page looking for uninstalled plugins.
- Upcoming events (in the block of the same name) are now sorted by start date
  and start time, which makes more sense than the old start date, end date
  sort order (reported by Peter Sieradzki).
- Fixed description of function DB_count() in lib-database.php (reported by
  jose on IRC).
- Changed the "getBent" block to test the real admin directory in case it has
  been renamed (bug #762881).
- Saving the user profile also saved the privacy options, setting them all to
  "off" (reported by Dwight Trumbower).
- Check the topic permissions when doing a search on stories and comments.
- Check the topic permissions when displaying the new stories and comments in
  the What's New block.
- Need to use date_sub() in the SQL request for the display=new mode on the
  index page to ensure compatibility with old versions of MySQL (reported by
  Markus Guske).
- New users created manually from the Admin's User menu were assigned a
  random password, even when the Admin entered one (reported by TechFan).
  This bug was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1.
- The printer-friendly version of a story in HTML format should not call
  nl2br() on the story text (bug #762636).
- When attempting to edit a submission, check that it still exists in the
  submission queue (since another Admin could already have handled it),
  avoiding an SQL error (reported by Simon Lord).

- New language file for formal German (addressing the user as "Sie" instead of
  "Du"), provided by Philip Sack.
- Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65.
- Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata.
- Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik.
- Updated Spanish language file, provided by Angel Romero.
- Updated Swedish language file, provided by Markus Berg.

- New formal German language file for the Static Pages plugin.
- New Italian language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by quess65.
- New Japanese language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Yusuke
  Sakata.
- New Swedish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Markus Berg


June 29, 2003 (1.3.8rc1)
-------------

- Fixed SQL error when using quotes in a group description.
- Fixed bug where blocks assigned to a topic disappeared when viewing articles.
- Add new Plugin API PLG_getHeaderCode, Used to return JS Functions or other
  Header Meta Tags required by the plugin. Added new variable {plg_headercode}
  to the template header.thtml files.
- New search: You can search for the exact phrase, all of the words, or any of
  the words from the query. Search words are highlighted in stories. Also,
  results in stories and comments are listed separately.
- Added new block "Privacy Options" to the Preferences:
  + chose to receive email from admins and/or other users
  + chose to show up in Who's Online block
  (Feature requests #609758 and #609759)
- New config option $_CONF['hide_author_exclusion'] to hide the author
  exclusion list from the user's preferences (useful e.g. when it's a rather
  long list but hardly used by the users of your site).
- Added tracking of users lastlogin to the userinfo table.
  New $_CONF['lastlogin'] added to config.php - SESSION SETTINGS area
- Added an option in admin/group.php to list all the users belonging to a group.
- Added adminoption_off.thtml template file (for current entry in the Admin
  menu) and topicoption.thtml and topicoption_off.thtml files (for entries in
  the Topics/Sections menu).
- Geeklog will not accept topic ids containing spaces any more.
- Added new config option $_CONF['allow_account_delete'] to allow users to
  delete their account (from their Account Information page).
- Posts (stories and comments) from deleted users will now be reassigned to
  user "Anonymous".
- Removed the Geeklog version number from the footer of the default themes.
  Instead, the version number is now displayed in the headline of the "Command
  and Control" block (moderation.php) and next to the "GL Version Test" entry
  in the Admin's functions block.
- New Norwegian language file, provided by Torfinn Ingolfsen.
- Introduced new config.php variable $_CONF['mysqldump_options'] that holds
  additional options to be used when Geeklog calls mysqldump to do a backup
  of the database.
- Added a check for an existing email address in the user's profile so that
  users can't change their email address to one that's already in use for
  another account.
- Pick up the 'postmode' default setting for the Admin's story editor.
- Stories in the Daily Digest are now sorted by date (newest first, as on the
  index page).
- Changed handling of plugin comments slightly: Plugins will have to do the
  'delete' operation on their comments on their own now since Geeklog can't
  possibly know which (if any) permissions are needed to delete a comment.
  The 'id' parameter in the call to plugin_handlecomment_<type> will now
  always be the comment id.
- In another attempt to solve the various issues regarding "www vs. non-www"
  URLs and related login problems:
  + Made sure all setcookie() calls use all 6 parameters
  + Try to guess the correct value for $_CONF['cookiedomain'] if it isn't set
  + Removed the redirection attempt from index.php
- When requesting a new password for your account, you can now enter either
  your username or the email address you used to register with the site.
- Added a speed limit for requests for a new password (defaults to 5 minutes
  between requests).
- The commentspeedlimit and submitspeedlimit tables have been replaced with a
  general speedlimit table and three new functions operating on it have been
  introduced (in lib-common.php). The new table has a 'type' field, so plugins
  could easily implement their own speed limits.
- Introduced new "forgot password" functionality: When requesting a new password
  for an account, the user will now receive an email with a link that s/he has
  to click on. It will take the user to a form where s/he can enter a new
  password (a unique id is contained in the URL and checked when entering the
  new password, thus preventing misuse). The old password remains valid until a
  new password is entered from this form, so the email can simply be ignored in
  case the user didn't request a new password (cf. Feature Request #567979).
- Removed unused commentheader.thtml file from all default themes.
- Fixed the redirect after posting a comment to a poll (should return to the
  poll, not to the index page).
- You can now "clone" events, i.e. make a copy of an existing event. This comes
  in handy if you have a lot of similar events (e.g. repeating events).
  Template files admin/event/eventlist.thtml and admin/event/listitem.thtml
  need to be updated or the "clone" option will not show up ...
- Fixed a bug in the Admin's poll editor which let you enter more than
  $_CONF['maxanswers'] answers for a poll. You may need to adjust your setting
  of $_CONF['maxanswers'] or you may lose an answer when editing such a poll
  (found & fixed by Tom Willet).
- Moved hard-coded HTML for the poll block and poll results to new template
  files.
- When the theme uses a replacement function for COM_siteHeader and/or
  COM_siteFooter, we need to pass it the same parameter that the replaced
  function was being called with.
- Fixed "Last 10 comments by user" in the user's profile which was missing the
  comments to polls.
- When a new user registers, we need to check for a valid email address
  first (before searching the database to see if that address is already in use)
- You are now taken back to the moderation page after editing a story submission
- Fixed 'previous' link on the Admin's list of stories. Alternatively, you can
  now use {google_paging} there (requires a change in the template).
- Added -Q option to the mysqldump call when doing a database backup. This will
  enclose database names in quotes and thus prevent problems with special
  characters in table names as used by some plugins (bug #712901).
- Set the max length of the input field for the event URL to 128 characters
  (was 96) in the default themes (other themes may need adjusting).
- Fixed localisation of the date of all-day events in the event details.
- Added missing {event_location} variable in calendar/eventdetails.thtml
  template files.
- Fixed display of events spanning several days in the personal calendar.
- Moved hard-coded HTML for the login form in the User Functions block to a new
  template file.
- The Sections block now uses the useroption.thtml and the new
  useroption_off.thtml template files for the list of topics. You can also use
  $_CONF['hide_home_link'] to hide the "Home" link from the Sections block.
- New config option $_CONF['keep_unscaled_image'] allows you to keep the
  original, unscaled image after upload (in stories only, for now). The smaller,
  scaled image will be used as a thumbnail and link to the original image
  (based on code provided by Alexander Schmacks).
- In admin/database.php:
  + Made sure we really display the last 10 backups (fix by Alexander Schmacks)
  + Display total number of backups in the directory
  + Moved hard-coded HTML for the list of backups to template files
  + Replaced $PHP_SELF with $_CONF['site_admin_url']/database.php since
    $PHP_SELF seems to cause problems in some environments
- You can now make one topic the default topic. The topic selection in the
  story submission form will then default to this topic.
- When clicking on the "contribute" link from the topic index page, the new
  story will now default to the topic you just viewed.
  This only works with themes that use the {menu_elements} variable in
  header.thtml. Other themes can use the new variable {current_topic} which
  holds '&topic=<topicid>' when a topic is selected (and is empty otherwise).
- Integrated Vincent Furia's improvements for COM_exportRDF. You can now use
  $_CONF['rdf_limit'] to limit the number of stories in the RDF file by
  setting this to a number (e.g. 10) or a number of hours (e.g. 24h).
  $_CONF['rdf_storytext'] lets you add the story's introtext to the RDF feed.
  Also fixed a bug with un-escaped special characters in the feed's title.
- Added paging to the list of Static Pages (for more than 50 pages).
- Fixed problem with the Older Stories block disappearing when it was edited
  (e.g. moved from left to right), bug #670673.
- Fixed "late" update of portal blocks (bug #681855).
- Fixed mixing of comments from different plugins, found & fixed by Alan McKay.
- A theme can provide its own functions to render the site header and footer
  (this is not a new feature). Geeklog now expects those functions to be named
  <themename>_siteHeader and <themename>_siteFoote, respectively. Until now,
  it was, however, looking for the wrong function names ...
- Added the piece of code that is needed to make the Theme Tester work to
  lib-common.php (won't do anything without the Theme Tester block).
- Fixed SQL query for displaying new comments in the What's New block, provided
  by Marc Von Ahn (with some help from Rob Griffiths).
- Changes to make Geeklog install and work again on old versions of MySQL
  (e.g. MySQL 3.22). Special thanks to Markus Guske for providing the fixes
  for the What's New block and for testing the new install.
- Feb 13/03: (Blaine) Added new Plugin function to support Center Blocks
  Included call to PLG_showCenterblock in index.php
- The user's signature is now appended to messages sent to another user.
- Feb 6/03: (Blaine)  Added support for custom user registration and account
  profile: Added hooks to users.php, usersettings.php  and admin/user.php and
  new $_CONF parm to enable
  Developer is responsible for code to handle new form processing, account
  record save, update and delete.
- The list of blocks now includes a column indicating whether the block is
  enabled or disabled (will need changes in admin/block/listblocks.thtml and
  listitem.thtml template files of custom themes).
- Variable {rdf_url} (available in footer.thtml) holds the URL of the RDF file.
- What's Related block is now created dynamically.
- Top Ten Commented Stories didn't count comments on stories submitted by
  anonymous users (found & fixed by Laurence Whitworth).
- Allow users to change their username if $_CONF['allow_username_change'] is
  set to 1.
- Jan 18/03: (Blaine) Corrected problem in mysql.class.php where the checks in
  dbdelete, dbchange, dbcount and dbcopy for a passed value of 0 were not
  sufficient. If the parameter was 0 - it was assuming it was empty.
  Consequence: The dbdelete would delete all records or dbcount would return
  count(*)
- Display Preferences and Comment Preferences have been merged. There is now
  only one option, Preferences, in the User Functions block.
- Hard-coded HTML for the Display Preferences, Comment Preferences, and
  Account information has been moved to template files (new "preferences"
  directory).

Static Pages Plugin 1.3
-----------------------
- Integrated (and extended) the Static Pages plugin 1.2 (originally started by
  Phill Gillespie and later supported by Tom Willet). This "combined" version
  is now called Static Pages 1.3.
  Use Geeklog's install script to upgrade from any previous version (1.1 or 1.2)
- Supports the use of PHP in static pages.
- You can now edit the ID of a static page to create more readable URLs like
  http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=about
  In combination with Geeklog's $_CONF['url_rewrite'] option, the URL can even
  look like http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/page/about
- You can now "clone" static pages, i.e. make a copy of an existing page.
- Removed the "static pages on frontpage" hack and changed the plugin to use
  the new Center Block API instead:
  A static page can now be displayed on the top of the front page, on the
  bottom, or after the featured story. It can also replace the front page
  entirely. Instead of using special label names (like "frontpage"), the
  display mode and position can now be selected from drop-down menus in the
  static pages editor.

Please see docs/staticpages.html for details.


January 26, 2004 (1.3.7sr5)
----------------

This release addresses the following security issues:

1. It was possible for users in the Group Admin and User Admin groups to
   become a member of the Root group (reported by Samuel M. Stone, bug #135).
2. Being admin for a certain area (e.g. Story Admin for stories) made it
   possible to delete all objects in that area (e.g. stories) even if the
   user was not supposed to have access to them, provided the id of the object
   was known.
3. It was possible to delete other people's personal events if you knew the
   event ID.
4. It was possible to browse through the comments of a story even if the user
   did not have access to the actual story (reported by Peter Roozemaal).
5. Due to an XSS issue, it was possible to change someone's account settings
   (including the password) if you got them to click on a specially crafted
   link (reported by Jelmer, fix suggested by Vincent Furia).
6. The comment display suffered from the possibility of an SQL injection
   (reported by Jelmer).
7. It was possible to inject Javascript code in the calendar (reported by
   Jelmer).
8. It was possible to execute (but not save) Javascript code in the comment
   preview (reported by Jelmer).


December 5, 2003 (1.3.7sr4)
----------------

This release addresses the following security-related issues:

1. As "dr.wh0" pointed out, the category field for link submissions was not
   filtered at all. Although you probably can't cause too much harm with
   those 32 characters, this has now been fixed.
2. Vincent Furia found that the restrictions for the form to email users
   could be circumvented and could even be used to spam users.
3. There was a way to post comments anonymously even when posting for
   anonymous users had been disabled.
4. It was possible to post comments under someone else's username.


October 12, 2003 (1.3.7sr3)
----------------

This release is intended to address some of the security issues reported in
September and early October 2003.

1. Includes Ulf Harnhammar's kses HTML filter to address possible Javascript
   injections and CSS defacements.

   When upgrading from an earlier version, please make sure to copy over the
   $_CONF['user_html'] and $_CONF['admin_html'] arrays from the included
   config.php to your own copy of that file.

2. While almost all of the alleged SQL injection issues could not be
   reproduced, this release includes an update to the MySQL class to not
   report SQL errors in the browser any more (but only in Geeklog's error.log).
   This will avoid disclosing any sensitive information as part of the error
   message.

   Please note that at the moment we do NOT recommend to use Geeklog with
   MySQL 4.1 (which, at the time of this writing, is in alpha state and should
   not be used on production sites anyway).

   An upcoming release of Geeklog will address the remaining SQL issues,
   including any problems with MySQL 4.1.


May 26, 2003 (1.3.7sr2)
------------

Security issues:

1. It was possible to obtain valid session ids for every account (reported by
   SCAN Associates).
2. Using Internet Explorer, it was possible to upload an image with embedded
   PHP code and execute it (reported by SCAN Associates).
3. Story permissions could override topic permissions, resulting in the display
   of stories to users who shouldn't have access to them (reported by Andrew
   Lawlor).
   Note: This was already fixed with the new index.php, released 2003-05-15.
4. Added a warning in config.php that adding any of the following tags to the
   list of allowable HTML can make the site vulnerable to scripting attacks:
   <img> <span> <marquee> <script> <embed> <object> <iframe>
   (pointed out by Joat Dede)

- Fixed the bug in several of the admin areas (blocks, events, links, polls,
  stories, topics) where admins without root access got a message stating
  that they did not have the proper permissions when trying to save an object.
- Fixed a typo in lib-sessions.php that caused the creation of unnecessary
  sessions (pointed out by Kobaz).
- Fixed malformed cookie (used $_CONF['site_url'] instead of
  $_CONF['cookiedomain']) in lib-sessions.php, found & fixed by Jon Evans.
- Fixed a bug that prevented certain right blocks from showing up when there
  were no stories for a topic.
- The "Google paging" on the index page may have displayed the wrong number
  of pages for users who disabled topics in their display preferences.

- Updated Dutch language file, provided by Claudio.
- Updated French language file, provided by Jaques.
- Updated Hellenic (Greek) language file, provided by Access-=-Denied Networks
- Updated Spanish and Spanish (Argentina) language files,
  provided by Fernando Bernardini
- New Portuguese language file, provided by Mario Seabra
- New Bulgarian language file, provided by lachko
- New Turkish language file, provided by Sinan Ussakli
- New Slovenian language file, provided by gape
- New Slovak language file, provided by Rado
- New Romanian language file, provided by Dan Gheorghitza
- New Chinese language file (gb2312 encoding), provided by Crocodile King
- New Czech language file, provided by Hermes Trismegistos


January 13, 2003 (1.3.7sr1)
----------------

Security issues:

1. Javascript code could be used in the homepage link of a user's profile
   (reported by Jin Yean Tan).
2. Javascript code could be injected in several URLs so that these could then
   be used for a cross-site scripting attack (reported by Jin Yean Tan).
3. Anybody could delete comments, provided they knew the comment id.
4. A StoryAdmin could manipulate any story, even if permissions should have
   prevented that. The same applied to Admins for links, events, polls, topics,
   and blocks (reported by Kobaz).

- The new user notification email was always sent out, even if 'user' was not
  listed in $_CONF['notification'].
- In admin/database.php, added a check to test if function is_executable() is
  available (since it is not available on Windows).
- {copyright_notice} in the site's footer (footer.thtml) will now use the
  current year for the copyright notice. You can override this by setting
  $_CONF['copyrightyear'] to the year you want.
  Also, new variables {lang_copyright} and {current_year} as well as {site_name}
  and {site_slogan} are now available in footer.thtml so that you can build a
  customised copyright notice from them.
- Fixed incomplete links to search results from poll comments.
- Fixed wrong link to the week view from the last week of the month view.
- Fixed bug where links was not using the date field - being stored as null.
- Fixed image resizing when using ImageMagick.
- Added the actual and max. image dimensions in the error message that is
  displayed when an image exceeds the max. image dimensions and no imagelib
  is configured.
- The Admin menu will now be displayed for users which have Admin access to
  a plugin but not to a core Geeklog Admin feature.
- The redirect in index.php (when a site is called up with a URL other than
  the one configured in $_CONF['site_url']) now checks for the existence of
  $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_HOST']. Also, the server name comparison is done
  case-insensitive now.
- New config option $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault']: Set to 1 if new users
  should be subscribed to the daily digest automatically. Defaults to 0 (no
  automatic subscribtion), thus restoring the behaviour of Geeklog prior to
  1.3.7.
- Removed some unused / outdated files (include and etc directories)
- Updated URLs to point to www.geeklog.net and lists.geeklog.net instead of the
  now outdated places on Sourceforge.
- Updated Dutch language file, provided by R.F. van der Veen
- New Danish language files (for Geeklog and for the Static Pages plugin),
  provided by Steen Broelling


December 16, 2002 (1.3.7)
-----------------

- In all Admin editors, the hard-coded default group permissions have been
  changed from 3 (read/write) to 2 (read-only).
- Make sure an error message is displayed when a StoryAdmin tries to edit a
  story s/he does not have access to.
- Hide topics from the Admin's list of stories that the current (Story)Admin
  has no access to.
- Tom Willet found a problem in admin/user.php that sometimes mangled user
  names, especially on sites hosted on sourceforge.net.
- Fixed an SQL error when using single quotes in a block title.
- When updating events in the master calendar, make sure copies of such events
  in the personal calendars are updated as well (including deleting them when
  the original event is removed from the master calendar).
- Fixed PRIMARY KEY for table personal_events, so that more than one user can
  add an event to his/her personal calendar.

- New Hellenic (Greek) language file, provided by Access-=-Denied Networks
- New Spanish language file, provided by LeChuck
- Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik
- Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65
- Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata


December 3, 2002 (1.3.7rc1)
----------------

- Modifed savesubmission() to better handle Plugin return - Bug ID 642106
- Modified Comment Plugin API Comment call - PLG_handlePluginComment now passes
  $operation to indicate a 'save' or 'delete'.
- Fixed problems with the portal.php redirect for links (bug #579221).
- Fixed a problem when uploading images with certain versions of Opera.
- When deleting a topic, also remove stories for that topic from the submission
  queue.
- Added a redirect in index.php when the site was called up with the "wrong"
  URL (i.e. not the one that has been set in $_CONF['site_url']), thus
  fixing the "www vs. non-www" problem where people showed up in Who's Online
  but did not get the User Functions block.
- The topic selection in the daily digest now defaults to "on" for all topics,
  i.e. when the daily digest is activated ($_CONF['emailstories'] = 1) and
  a user has not selected any topics yet, s/he will receive a digest for all
  topics. This ensures that new topics are automatically added to the daily
  digest (bug #573305).
- Fixed a permission problem with the daily digest where users could get a
  digested version of a story they didn't have access to.
- Fixed permission problems in the statistics where story titles, links, and
  events where listed even when the current user did not have access to them.
- Added the Top Ten Links to the links page (only when links are displayed
  per category).
- When sending emails, Geeklog now uses \r\n in the mail headers which should
  resolve problems under Windows.
- Resolved a couple of stripslashes() issues.
- The static pages plugin can now be uninstalled using the "delete" option
  from the plugin editor. Note that this will only remove the plugin's tables
  and data from the database, not remove any files.
- Added a simple email notification when a new story, link, or event has been
  submitted or a new user has registered. See $_CONF['notification'] for details
- Added a separate set of config variables for the max. dimensions of user
  photos ($_CONF['max_photo_width'] etc.).
- Fixed a problem when resizing GIF images using the netpbm tools.
- Check the topic permissions when presenting a list of topics in the Admin
  story editor (since the StoryAdmin may not have access to all topics).
- Removed the Normal / Archive / Refreshing drop down menus from the admin
  story and poll editors since they're not used anyway.
- In the links section, do not display link categories when the current user
  does not have access to the links in those categories (bug #612869).
- Fixed problems when using quotes in the title of an HTML-formatted comment
  (including confusing error messages and wrong speed limit alerts).
- Changed the way how Geeklog checks if it's currently displaying the site's
  front page, thus fixing the problem with disappearing "homeonly" blocks.
- Fixed double line spacing in HTML-formatted comments and [code] sections when
  running on PHP 4.2.0 and up.
- Fixed problems with slashes and HTML entities in emails sent out by Geeklog
  (Send story to friend, daily digest, Admin mail utility).
- Added new config variable 'showfirstasfeatured' which, when set to 1, will
  render the first story on _any_ page like it was a featured story.
- Added admin/plugins/newpluginlist.thtml and newlistitem.thml template files
  for the list of plugins not installed yet. These files are optional, i.e.
  the list will be formatted using hard-coded HTML when they don't exist.
- Removed unused template file admin/plugins/installform.thtml.
- The plugin menu will now list all plugins which exist in the file system
  but haven't been installed (yet) with a link to their install script for
  easy installation (based on code provided by Blaine Lang).
- New plugin API function PLG_callCommentForm() and improvements for the use of
  comments in plugins, provided by Blaine Lang.
- The Older Stories block did not take stories into account which were to be
  published in the future. Therefore, the block sometimes listed stories that
  were still on the first index page.
- Added variable {contributedby_photo} (user photo of story author) for use in
  story templates.
- Users couldn't disable display of the Older Stories block in their preferences
- The contents of the Older Stories block was deleted whenever you changed it
  (e.g. moving it from the left to the right column).
- The static pages editor displayed a blank page when the title and/or content
  field of a new static page were not filled in (will display an error message
  now).
- Implemented fixes for plugins using the submission queue, suggested by
  Vincent Furia.
- Following the link "X stories in last 24 hours" from the What's New block
  will now display only the new stories on the index page.
- When $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] = 2, the search is completely blocked
  for anonymous users (1 will only block the advanced search).
- Added a check to test for a valid date format when searching by date.
- Added $_CONF['skip_preview'] to allow submission of comments and stories
  without previewing (defaults to off).
- Search queries with less than 3 characters are now rejected to reduce server
  load.
- (Event)Admins couldn't add events directly to their personal calendar
  (found & fixed by Kenn Osborne).
- Fixed a nasty bug in SEC_inGroup() (in lib-security.php) that let a user
  admin change the password of a root user, so that effectively every user
  admin could become a root user ...
- Topics are now sorted alphabetically by the topic name instead of by topic id.
- Added several new variables which can be used in the story template files.
- New config options $_CONF['dateonly'] and $_CONF['timeonly'] which hold the
  format string for day + month (to be used in the Upcoming Events and Older
  Stories blocks) and the time (to be used for event details).
- Fixed calls to unknown function printErrorMsgs in the file upload class.
- New options in config.php:
  $_CONF['upcomingeventsrange'] = no. of days to look ahead for upcoming events
  $_CONF['emailstoryloginrequired'] = disallow "send story be email" for
  anonymous users
  $_CONF['hideemailicon'], $_CONF['hideprintericon'] = hide email / printer
  icon from stories (and from Story Options block)
  $_CONF['hidenewstories'], $_CONF['hidenewcomments'], $_CONF['hidenewlinks'] =
  hide new stories / comments / links from What's New block
- User photos are now resized according to the image dimensions in config.php
  (if an imagelib is configured - otherwise images exceeding those dimensions
  are rejected).
- Added a check for the proper permissions on the admin page of the Static
  Pages plugin.
- Plugins can now return "false" (or an empty array) from
  plugin_cclabel_<plugin-name> so that the plugin's icon does not show up
  in moderation.php if the user does not have the proper access rights for the
  plugin. Changed the Static Pages plugin to do exactly that.
- Fixed problems when using multiple [code] ... [/code] sections.
- PHP blocks which return an empty string are not displayed any more. This
  allows PHP blocks to "hide" themselves.
- Searching for links caused an SQL error on installs that were upgraded
  from Geeklog 1.1 (missing "date" field in links table). However, links don't
  use that field anyway, so searching by date was removed (the "date" field
  will be added when upgrading the database to 1.3.7).
  Also, the search results are now sorted by link title.
- The calendar displayed an empty last week (in month view) for some months,
  e.g. November 2002.
- COM_pollResults() will not use the side block templates when called from
  pollbooth.php (thus allowing different block layouts for the poll results
  in a side block and in pollbooth.php).
- Allow for theme-based topic icons by using the $_THEME_URL variable as the
  base directory for topic icons (if that variable is set).
- Fixed display (or lack thereof) of $ signs in portal blocks.
- lib-common.php didn't use $_CONF['path_language'] to include the default
  language file.
- What's Related block
  + content is now set for all user submitted stories (previously, links where
    only added in stories submitted by the Admin or user submissions edited by
    the Admin)
  + block is not displayed when it's empty
  + now uses COM_makeList() (i.e. the list.thtml and listitem.thtml template
    files) instead of hard-coded <li> tags
- The What's Related and Story Options blocks can now be used independent of
  each other in the article/article.thtml template file - use {whats_related},
  {story_options} or {whats_related_story_options}.
- Theme authors can now use the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE "hack" for the What's Related
  and Story Options blocks as well (using 'whats_related_block' and
  'story_options_block' as the block names).
- Fixed the "noboxes" feature where all blocks (with the exception of the
  section, login / user functions, and admin blocks) are hidden.
- Changed admin/link/listitem.thtml so that the URLs in the Admin's list of
  links are clickable.
- Fixed an SQL error when calling search.php and there were no stories and no
  comments in the system.
- Fixed an SQL error in the user profile when there were no stories and no polls
  in the system.
- Fixed date bug when previewing stories to be posted around the noon hour in
  the admin story editor.
- Added sanity checks in admin/story.php to prevent possible loss of stories
  when using an incomplete language file (or manipulating the URL).
- Fixed a variable in admin/plugins/editor.ththml of the Smooth Blue theme.
- Fixed a typo and a grammatical error in english.php
- Fixed problems with the "static page as frontpage" hack:
  + will now check if the static pages plugin is installed and enabled
  + uses sp_format (i.e. display blocks as specified in the static pages editor)
  + added a missing stripslashes() call
  New: When you have $_SP_CONF['in_block'] == 1 and the label of the static
  page is neither empty nor "nonews" then that label is used as the block title
  for the static page.
- The "userevent" table is back in lib-database.php. Geeklog doesn't use this
  table any more, but the name is needed when upgrading from old versions.

- Updated Dutch language file, provided by R. F. van der Veen
- Updated French language file, provided by Florent Guiliani
- The German language file now uses the proper national special characters
  (umlauts) instead of HTML entities.

September 20, 2002 (1.3.6)
------------------
- Images in stories can now be resized automatically during upload, provided
  you have either ImageMagick or netpbm installed. See the image settings in
  config.php for details.
- If you create a static page with the title "Frontpage" then the content of
  this static page will be displayed above the first story on the front page
  of your site. If you additionally set the label of this static page to
  "nonews", then the static page will completeley replace the news on the front
  page of your site.
  You may want to wrap static pages in a block - set $_SP_CONF['in_block'] = 1;
  in /path/to/geeklog/plugins/staticpages/config.php
- A user assigned only to the Mail Admin group wasn't able to use the "Mail
  Users" function.
- The filter to disable Javascript onXXX events also changed certain links in
  HTML postings. This should be fixed now.
- The poll uses a POST instead of a GET request now to at least prevent
  primitive manipulation attempts ...
- Events on the same day were displayed in the order they were entered, not
  in the order they were scheduled (occured in day, week, and month view).
- The user function and admin blocks weren't using the proper templates when
  the theme was using the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE trick, as outlined in
  <http://www.geeklog.net/article.php?story=20020429092841722>.
- When the first character of the content of a block is a '<' it is now
  assumed that the block contains HTML and nl2br() is not applied to the
  block content. This allows proper HTML usage and even the use of Javascript
  in blocks.
- Sanity checks have been added to the admin editors (including the editor
  for static pages) to prevent possible damage to the database in case of
  incomplete translations (language files) or invalid IDs.
- The delete button in the plugin editor, which was unused since the removal
  of the automated plugin install (in Geeklog 1.3.4), will now cause a function
  plugin_uninstall_<plugin name> to be called. This allows plugins to uninstall
  themselves (if possible).
- The author's name was missing from emailed stories. Also changed it so that
  the author's name is only included when $_CONF['contributedbyline'] == 1.
  The daily digest now also includes the author's name.
- Fixed the "1054: Unknown column 'deleted' in 'where clause'" SQL error that
  some people were getting when logging out.
- Submitted stories will now pick up the permissions from the topic they were
  posted under (instead of using default permissions).
- Added new features story.submit, link.submit, event.submit which, when
  assigned to a group, allow members of that group to post directly (skipping
  the submission queue) even when the submissione queue is active.
- Fixed issues with backslashes in block titles, as suggested by Neil Darlow.
- The page navigation is now wrapped in a <div class="pagenav"> so that it
  can be formatted by a theme using CSS.
  Because of this change, the template files admin/user/userslist.thtml and
  links/links.thtml had to be changed, because they wrapped the page navigation
  in a <p>.
- Submission of links and events by anonymous users failed when the link
  submission queues were switched off.
- Anonymous users were able to submit comments even when $_CONF['loginrequired']
  was set to 1.
- Fixed a search bug introduced in 1.3.6rc1 when searching by author.
- When updating from an earlier version, the install script will no longer try
  to rename the staticpage table when no prefix is used in the database.
- PLG_getUserOptions() will no longer return empty menu options.
- Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65
- Changed some wording in the German language file
- Fixed spelling errors in the English language file


August 28, 2002 (1.3.6rc1)
---------------
- Problems with using the dollar sign in stories, comments, and their titles
  have been fixed.
- Fresh installations now have a "Are you secure?" block pre-installed
  that only the Admin can see and which does some (very simple) tests whether
  the site is secure or not.
- Fixed the page navigation in (admin's) user list.
- Using the preview in the admin story editor will now keep the topic icon
  and the time will not revert from pm to am any more.
- The links section now includes a list of the link categories at the top.
  The list of links is now also separated into pages (10 links per page by
  default, configurable in config.php).
  To get back the old (pre-1.3.6) style of the links section, just set both
  $_CONF['linkcols'] and $_CONF['linksperpage'] (in config.php) to 0.
  These changes are based on code provided by Tom Willett.
- Fixed the SQL syntax for some requests ("count(*) AS count" instead of
  "count(*) count") which seems to have caused problems with some (older)
  versions of MySQL.
- A proper error message is now displayed when attempting to use "Mail Users"
  but not filling out all the fields.
- Editing a portal block shouldn't make it disappear any more ...
- The somewhat random order of poll answers has been fixed.
- The site can be disabled by setting $_CONF['site_enabled'] = false; in
  config.php. $_CONF['site_disabled_msg'] can either contain a message to be
  displayed in that case or a URL (has to start with http:) to which all
  requests will be redirected.
- Fixed various access rights / privacy issues where users could see (but
  not access) information even when they shouldn't ...
  + Search returns only those stories, comments, links, and events to which the
    user has the proper access rights
  + What's New block counts stories and comments according to access rights
    now (this should also fix the problems some people had when New Comments
    were not displayed for anonymous users). New Links also take access rights
    into account.
  + Upcoming events are only visible to those with the proper rights.
  + Topics are not available for submissions without proper rights.
  + Topic selection in the user preferences also follows access rights.
  + "Last 10 comments" (and the new "Last 10 stories too, of course) in profile
    takes proper rights into account
- Story display and paged navigation weren't working properly when some stories
  were only accessible to certain users.
- Fixed a bug where users weren't able to use the site when their theme had
  been removed (until they cleared their cookies).
- New installations now have only two default accounts: The Admin account (as
  before) and a Moderator account that has access to the story, links, and
  events submission queues.
- The Older Stories block should work again.
- The submission queues for stories, links, events, and users can now be
  switched off separately (in config.php), i.e. items submitted by users will
  then be visible to everybody immediately.
- The database backup is more verbose now, especially when there are problems
  (changes provided by Blaine Lang).
- Fixed a bug where the admin's user photo overwrote a user's photo when the
  admin was editing the user's account information.
- Group editor:
  + Could not create new groups when using a non-english language file.
  + Once you've added one group to another (by checking off an option from
    the "Security Groups" list), there was no way to uncheck it again.
  + The message after saving/deleting a group said that the topic(!) had been
    saved/deleted ...
- Changes in search:
  + Should be faster now.
  + Search by date did not work (mostly because the date format recommended to
    be used in a search is really YYYY-MM-DD and not MM-DD-YYYY).
  + List of authors is now sorted by username.
  + Search results for links are now routed via portal.php, too, so that the
    links are counted when clicked.
  + When no results are returned for a search, then the search form will now
    be displayed below that message again.
- The static pages plugin uses the table prefix now (databases created with
  Geeklog 1.3.5 or older need to be upgraded).
- A user submission queue has been added. When activated in config.php
  ($_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1;), new users will not get their password
  emailed until they are approved by an admin.
  You can, however, let users from certain domains be approved automatically
  by adding their domain names to the comma-separated list of domains in
  $_CONF['allow_domains'].
- Fixed problems with quotes in poll question and answers.
- The default value for the number of stories per page for a new user is now
  taken from $_CONF['limitnews'] (was hard-coded to 10).
- The user profile has been extended to include
  + last 10 stories by that user
  + total number of stories and comments posted by that user
  + link to search for all postings by that user
- The title of an article is now displayed in the page title (again).
- New configuration option $_CONF['allow_user_language'] to allow / prevent
  to change the language. When set to 0, the option to switch the language
  is hidden from the user preferences.
- The message "You have successfully logged out" should not show up any more
  when you log out and log in again.
- The blocks stating that the search returned no results (e.g. for links) are
  now switched off by default but can be switched on again with the new
  configuration variable $_CONF['showemptysearchresults'].
- Fixed the list of authors in the search form (did not list all authors).
- Fixed search results for links and events: They always displayed only one
  result, even when there where more hits. Also, when searching for authors,
  no hits amongst the links and events will be returned (since they have
  no author).
- In the admin menu, the count of available submissions is now displayed
  according to the admin's access rights (e.g. don't count story submissions
  for someone who's only a link admin).
- Links in the What's New block are now counted when clicked (for the site
  statistics).
- Fixed a stray "(N/A)" that would show up in the admin menu for admins which
  were not static pages admins.
- You can now block anonymous users from accessing any part of a Geeklog site
  or you can block them from certain parts, e.g. block anonymous access to the
  calendar (via a new set of XXXloginrequired flags in config.php).
  Please note that $_CONF['loginrequired'] is now used to require login to all
  areas. To require login for submissions, use $_CONF['submitloginrequired'].
- New RDF/RSS parser, provided by Roger Webster. This should now properly
  import even those RDF feeds which Geeklog previously refused to display.
- Updated language files:
  + Italian, provided by quess65
  + Japanese, provided by Yusuke Sakata
  + Polish, provided by Robert Stadnik
- Various fixes for the consistent use of $_CONF['site_admin_url'] instead of
  $_CONF['site_url']/admin, provided by Gene Wood.
- The static pages plugin can now wrap static pages in a block
  (available as an option in staticpages.cfg)
- You can now use [code] ... [/code] in stories and comments (HTML formatted
  only) to mark portions of the text as containing code of any form (HTML, PHP,
  any other programming language). Geeklog will then reproduce this section
  verbatim, i.e. not interpreting any special characters in that section.
- Fixed type pulldown menu in search when more than one plugin was used.
- Signatures in comments are working again.
- The daily digest uses $_CONF['shortdate'] now
- New configuration variable $_CONF['emailstorieslength'] to specify the length
  of stories sent in the daily digest: 0 = only the title and a link to the
  story are included, 1 = entire introtext is included (default), any other
  number = cut off text after that amount of characters.
- The selection of the user theme is now hidden from the user's preferences
  when 'allow_user_themes' is turned off in config.php
- The links "Add To My Calendar" are now hidden when personal calendars are
  turned off in config.php
- Fixed a bug where the number of submissions was displayed in the sections
  block even when that was turned off.
- New variable $_CONF['adminhtml'] allows (Story)Admin to use a wider variety
  of HTML tags than the ordinary user.
- Fixed COM_exportRDF so that only articles that anonymous users have access to
  show up.
- Search: User drop down only shows users that have posted a comment or a story.
- Fixed bug with double quotes in title of story submission.
- The upcoming events block uses the list templates now.
- The story option block uses the list templates now.
- The (Event)Admin could not delete events (delete button was missing).
- The calendar class reverted to using the english day and month names as
  soon as you called setCalendarMatrix().
- Added {edit_link} in story templates in Classic theme.
- All admin editors have the save / cancel / delete buttons at the bottom now.
- The link to the plugin homepage did not work from the plugin editor.
- Added $_CONF['default_charset'] in config.php and $LANG_CHARSET in the
  language files to specify a character set to be used for the web pages (use
  {charset} in header.thtml) and email sent by Geeklog.
- Changes in the themes and the admin editors, moving lots of hard-coded
  english texts to the language files.
  This affects most of the files in the admin and calendar directories within
  the themes directories.
- The static pages plugin will now pick the language automatically, based on
  the user / default setting for the language. Currently, only English and
  German language files are included.
- New variables that can be used in footer.thtml: {execution_textandtime},
  {powered_by}.


July 8, 2002 (1.3.5sr2)
-------------
- New installation instructions (now back in docs/install.html).
  Please note that some of the other documentation may be out of date ...
- Display of stories in older stories block was off by one day.
- Number of guest users in Who's online block should now be reset properly.
- Added some scripts in admin/install to help with the installation:
  + info.php just does a phpinfo()
  + check.php will check the file and directory permissions
  + configinfo.php will display the contents of config.php
  Note: It is now even more important that you remove the install directory
  after the installation went through (or at least block read access to this
  directory).
- Disable all onXXX Javascript events in HTML postings (stories and comments).
- Fill in user name and email address when writing an email to a user (via
  the 'send email' form from the user profile).
- Make sure that the first comment to a story has the 'title' field filled in
  (previously, only comments to comments took over the title).
- Cut off the subject at the first linefeed when sending email to a user,
  thus preventing the injection of additional email headers.
- Added a test for register_globals=off in the install script (and display a
  warning if it is off). Also added a hint what the current path is and tries
  to guess the /path/to/geeklog.
- Fixed the "12pm bug": Posting a story between 12 and 1 pm would result in
  the story being posted with a date in 1969.
- Use mysql_connect() instead of mysql_pconnect() in MySQL class.
- The redirect after submitting a story always went to /index.php
- HTML tags are now stripped out of search queries.
- Removed the logging of all search queries to error.log.
- Fixed a wrong link from personal events in the upcoming events block.
- The "Home" link in the section block was not active on pages > 1. It was,
  however, always active on the home page when the Geeklog site was not
  located in the DocumentRoot.


June 10, 2002 (1.3.5sr1)
-------------
- This release addresses security issues recently discovered by the people at
  olympos.org. These issues allow for the injection of malicious javascript
  code (which could be used to access the admin's cookie) and the injection
  of MySQL code which could be used to access and even damaged the database
  (under certain circumstances). Details will be available in a report on
  the Bugtraq list shortly after this release is out.
- The following bugs from the 1.3.5 release have also been fixed:
  + missing field 'emailfromadmin' in userprefs table (fresh installs only)
  + fixed a typo that prevented the page navigation from working
  + fixed batch user import
  + fixed logo size and path to search in XSilver theme

--------------
- Change installation so that server configuration is manual, DB configuration is scripted
- Search page now properly generates the right link to search comments
- Comments to polls now show up in whats new block
- You can now specify the order the poll results show up in in config.php.  You can either sort by
  voteorder (highest number of votes -> lowest) or by the order they were saved in admin/poll.php
- You can now move /admin somewhere else in web tree.  This should help out folk where ISP's use /admin
  for their administration stuff.
- if you go to submit.php as an admin we will try to send you to the admin/ page for the type of thing you
  are trying to submit (e.g. story, link, event)
- fixed calendar.php so month view now shows events spanning multiple days on months other than the current
- admin/event.php now saves am/pm and allday properly
- PollAdmin group can now properly add a new poll.
- fixed SEC_getUserGroups() so that it always returns an array even if no groups are returned (e.g.
  empty array
- fixed moderation.php so post mode is saved properly from storysubmission to story table.
- killed 1064 bug in admin/event.php
- set error_reporting() so uninitialized variables don't show up (common in poorly configured PHP installs)
- gldefault blocks now actually use permissions assigned to them in admin/block.php
- Added all sorts of shit to english.php.  Translators will need to really take their time
  with this file.
- Added $_CONF['maximagesperarticle'] to config.php
- install.php was reworked a bit for upcoming release
- lib-common.php has changed.  can't even begin to note all the changes there
- admin/user.php has a very simple batch import utility.  You can now create multiple
  accounts by importing a tab-delimited file.  See that page for file format specs
- story.php was reworked a bit to be simplified and to correctly do paging (old
  paging feature had a bug where one article would never show up.
- admin/user.php now allows for paging and searching.  Check it out, you'll see what I mean ;-)
- blocks can now be disabled in admin/block.php
- added support for images in articles

  and for use in putting images in articles.

  usernames to be created.
- New strings in english.php (and german.php):
  $LANG02: 15 (moved from calendar_event.php)
  $LANG04: 74, 75, 76 (moved from usersettings.php)
  $LANG08: 31, 32, 33, 34 (moved from lib-common.php)
  These strings need to be added to the other language files!
- Fixed user selection of emailed topics (usersettings.php) and removed the
  hard coded texts for the daily digest from lib-common.php (again).
- Slightly changed display of event block: The type of event is no longer
  underlined and the event date is displayed as 03-Apr etc.
- Added Russion Translation
- Fixed bug #531483 where $_CONF['commentsloginrequired'] was set to 'on' or
  'off' instead of '1' or '0'.
- Fixed bug #529621 and added the variable layout_url in COM_endBlock in
  lib-common.php
- (Sort of) fixed bug #530142: {geeklog_blocks} is now set to an empty string
  in lib-common.php
- Fixed bug #531018: {contributedby_use} had an 'r' too many in lib-common.php
- There have been lots of minor changes in the themes so that they now contain
  valid HTML. Nearly all those change fall into one of the following categories:
  + changed '&' in URLs to '&amp;'
  + added alt="" to <img> tags
  + changed the script tags to <script type="text/javascript">
  + changed the DOCTYPE to HTML 4.01 (there is a bug in the HTML 4.0
    specification which prevents the use of 'name' attributes in forms).
  + added '#' signs in front of colour values (mostly in the Classic theme)
  These kinds of changes have also been applied to index.php and lib-common.php

  + Yahoo/header.thml referred to a non-existent file "spec.gif"
  + Yahoo/footer.thml: there was an extra quote after align="right"
  + Digital_Monochrom/admin/plugins/editor.thml: file was missing - copied
    over from the Classic theme)
  + Digital_Monochrom/footer.thtml: added a missing ';' after &nbsp
- admin/install/install.php had two <body> tags but was missing the </head>

March 7, 2002
-----------------
- Fixed broken older stories block (lib-common.php)
- Fixed problems with saving rights to a group in admin/group.php (admin/group.php)
- Fixed bug in admin/user that would reset user's settings when admin made a change (admin/user.php)
- Fixed bug in index.php.  There were two FOR loops, one nested inside the other both interating
  on the variable $i.  This caused problems only for users who went into display preferences and
  selected only the topics they wanted to get articles for (index.php)
- Fixed bug in story admin that would prevent the date edit from prepopulating right when admin hit
  the preview button (admin/story.php)
- Modified admin/plugin.php to reflect change in how plugins are installed.  Because of platform
  dependance issues, all plugins will have a simple but manual installation process.  This should
  work across all platforms. (admin/plugin.php, layout/Yahoo/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml,
  layout/Classic/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Digital_Monochrome/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml)
- Alter the database to force all stories to show on the frontpage by default.  This will make the
  moderation of articles work as expected.  Before if you approved an article it would show up only
  in the topic and not on the frontpage (mysql_tableanddata.sql, table.sql, mysql_1.3.3_to_1.3.4.sql)

March 1, 2002
-----------------
- Admins can now manually edit the publish date of an article.  This include the ability
  to set the date for a time in the future.  In that case the article is completely
  ignored by COM_exportRDF, stats.php, search.php and the email digest
- Rudimentary support for database backups (one per day at most).  There is no restore
  capability at this time.
- Modified the display preference so we store the blocks a user doesn't want to see instead
  of the ones they do want to see.  This will allow any new block to show up by default as
  expected.
- Removed hardcoded english from COM_emailUserTopics
- Fixed minor security bug with whats new block. It would display items the user didn't have access too (however, if they click them they would correctly get the access denied message)

January 11, 2001
-----------------
- Two security fixes, one major one.  This release addes a users MD5 password to a cookie that is checked when using the permanent cookie.  Prior to this you could change the permanent cookie to any user and get their access rights.  Second security fix addresses an orphaned group_assignments record that, one new Geeklog installations, would give the very first user to register with the site access to the GroupAdmin and UserAdmin groups
- In admin/block.php you can now specify the URL to a help file.  This is usefully in providing site help to your users

  other authors on the site don't like hand entering SQL!

  just love hand entering SQL!

June 18, 2000
-------------

- Optimizations made to the SQL connections and calls.  Too
  much done here to talk about, but part of it was moving
  the site configuration to a flat file.  These changes
  should decrease the usage of the SQL server a great deal.
  This took up most of my day.
- Variable usage optimizations.  Made many, many chnages in
  the way variables were being used.  This should result in
  cleaner, faster code that _may_ use a little less memory?
  Hey, if I can save 2k per hit, thats a big deal! :-)

  So from now on only php4 will be run on the Geeks web
  servers.  So I changed all the extentions and links from
  .php3 to .php to mark this moment.

  new security settings on the files.  Hmmm, I bet you
  wondering "what is this mad-man thinking?"

June 17, 2000
-------------

- Initial announcement, running this new code on the Geeks
  web servers.
- Special thanks to Jason Hines and phpWebLog! His work
  inspired much of my efforts!  Unfortunatly phpWebLog is
  taking a different direction that the Geeks sites needed.
  However, all the code I am writing here will be published
  in the hopes that Jason and others may find these functions
  useful.  If you looking for a weblog software that is cool,
  configurable and supported by someone I would recommend you
  check out http://phpweblog.org and party on dudes!
