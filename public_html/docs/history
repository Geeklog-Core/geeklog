GeekLog History/Changes:

- Fixed bug #531483 where $_CONF['commentsloginrequired'] was set to 'on' or
  'off' instead of '1' or '0'.
- Fixed bug #529621 and added the variable layout_url in COM_endBlock in
  lib-common.php
- (Sort of) fixed bug #530142: {geeklog_blocks} is now set to an empty string
  in lib-common.php
- Fixed bug #531018: {contributedby_use} had an 'r' too many in lib-common.php
- There have been lots of minor changes in the themes so that they now contain
  valid HTML. Nearly all those change fall into one of the following categories:
  + changed '&' in URLs to '&amp;'
  + added alt="" to <img> tags
  + changed the script tags to <script type="text/javascript">
  + changed the DOCTYPE to HTML 4.01 (there is a bug in the HTML 4.0
    specification which prevents the use of 'name' attributes in forms).
  + added '#' signs in front of colour values (mostly in the Classic theme)
  These kinds of changes have also been applied to index.php and lib-common.php
- During those changes for valid HTML, some typos were corrected:
  + Classic/header.thtml: added a missing <b> before {welcome_message}
  + Classic/storytext.thtml: added a missing 'n' in {end_contributedby_anchortag}
  + Yahoo/header.thml referred to a non-existent file "spec.gif"
  + Yahoo/footer.thml: there was an extra quote after align="right"
  + Digital_Monochrom/admin/plugins/editor.thml: file was missing - copied
    over from the Classic theme)
  + Digital_Monochrom/footer.thtml: added a missing ';' after &nbsp
- admin/install/install.php had two <body> tags but was missing the </head>

March 7, 2002
-----------------
- Fixed broken older stories block (lib-common.php)
- Fixed problems with saving rights to a group in admin/group.php (admin/group.php)
- Fixed bug in admin/user that would reset user's settings when admin made a change (admin/user.php)
- Fixed bug in index.php.  There were two FOR loops, one nested inside the other both interating
  on the variable $i.  This caused problems only for users who went into display preferences and
  selected only the topics they wanted to get articles for (index.php)
- Fixed bug in story admin that would prevent the date edit from prepopulating right when admin hit
  the preview button (admin/story.php)
- Modified admin/plugin.php to reflect change in how plugins are installed.  Because of platform 
  dependance issues, all plugins will have a simple but manual installation process.  This should
  work across all platforms. (admin/plugin.php, layout/Yahoo/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml,
  layout/Classic/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Digital_Monochrome/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml)
- Alter the database to force all stories to show on the frontpage by default.  This will make the
  moderation of articles work as expected.  Before if you approved an article it would show up only
  in the topic and not on the frontpage (mysql_tableanddata.sql, table.sql, mysql_1.3.3_to_1.3.4.sql)

March 1, 2002
-----------------
- Admins can now manually edit the publish date of an article.  This include the ability
  to set the date for a time in the future.  In that case the article is completely 
  ignored by COM_exportRDF, stats.php, search.php and the email digest
- Rudimentary support for database backups (one per day at most).  There is no restore
  capability at this time.
- Modified the display preference so we store the blocks a user doesn't want to see instead
  of the ones they do want to see.  This will allow any new block to show up by default as
  expected.
- Removed hardcoded english from COM_emailUserTopics
- Fixed minor security bug with whats new block. It would display items the user didn't have access too (however, if they click them they would correctly get the access denied message)

  create compatibilty between stories, comments
  and polls.
- Poll comments!
- Added a blockorder field to the blocks table. You 
  can now modify the display order of blocks.
- Fixed a bug in the link generation in stats.php.
- Changed the description field in the links
  tables from varchar(255) to text to allow for
  longer descriptions.
- Preview now uses article() function.  Shows a 
  true preview!
- Fixed a bug in comment.php that still may the 
  user type in a user name email even if if the
  anonymous option was chosen.  It never actually
  saved the info, just asked for it.  Now it no
  longer asks. :-)

-------------

- Correct setting of a user cookie in comment.php,
  contrib.php and profile.php.  The cookie was not 
  being set to remember a users infomation if they 
  selected to do so.
- Fixed the CSS layout for the comment bar, this 
  wasn't working properly under Netscape.
- Fixed an error in the change password function.  It
  was displaying a error even when the change was 
  successful.
- Made total votes a caculated field in the poll
  editor, this is also a easy way to reset the count
  in the case of SQL errors.
- Fixed topic sorting bug, topics sort themselves now.
  This also involved a change to the config.php file
  in which $CONF["topicssort"] was changed to
  $CONF["topicsort"].
- Added feature to track which admin moderated a 
  story and posted it to the site.

BETA RELEASE!!!  0.1.0!!! - June 27, 2000

June 27, 2000
-------------

- Added the ability to delete comments.  NOTE: I do
  not plan on the abilty to edit comments.  Just
  a personal thing, thats all.

June 26, 2000
-------------

- Created search engine that searched stories,
  comments and links.
- Update comments and how they are displayed.
- Created new form for submitting comments.
- Enhansed a bunch of the forms.
- Removed some obsolete stuff, cleaned things up a bit.
- Added some additional error checking to submits.  Also
  moved all error checking to the server side.  I was 
  testing the use of JavaScript but too many people 
  like to turn it off!  I know I do! :-)

June 25, 2000
-------------

- Squashed 23 bugs with the help of my wife!  Now if
  only Frank would get his bug reports in! 
- Created interface for editing, creating and deleting
  links.
- Cleaned PHP procedures out of inc files.
- Updated and tested SQL statements to refelct DB 
  changes.
- DB changes frozen for release and the beta testers 
  rejoiced!

June 24, 2000
-------------

- Created interface for editing, creating and deleting
  users.
- Figgin problem with polls deleting themselves seems
  to be fixed now.
- Created interface for editing, creating and deleting
  topics.
- Created interface for editing, creating and deleting
  blocks.
- Created interface for moderation, editing and posting
  of stories by admin.  This worked out well!

June 23, 2000
-------------

- Finished up additions to the datebase, need to change
  the forms now so the site can use the new fields.
  Some of the new feilds are for future use as well.
- Added descriptions to the Links page.
- Fixed the search page so its now formated correctly.
- Finished up the pollbooth functions (edit and delete).
- Optimized some of the HTML in the scripts, further 
  optimization later!

June 21, 2000
-------------

- Created a new layout format using all external CSS
  calls.  Let the client do the work!
- Finished moving configuration to config.php
- Weeded out some functions in common.php.  Move
  functions that are only used by one script to that
  script.  Combined other similar functions in to one
  function.  Smaller...  Faster... More Stable!
- Only 6 more items on the to do list for 0.1.0.0

June 20, 2000
-------------

- Created admin functions for the pollbooth.  Seems the 
  other authors on the site don't like hand entering SQL!
  I don't like them having shell accounts!  -grin-
- Update the Header feild in the Stories block to be a 
  little bigger.  This should let wordy authors emblish
  their titles more!
- Created a more robust errorlog routine.  Now has the
  options of output to a log, the screen or both!

June 19, 2000
-------------

- Created a pollbooth for voting.  All user functions are
  in pollbooth.php.  There are no admin functions yet as I
  just love hand entering SQL!

June 18, 2000
-------------

- Optimizations made to the SQL connections and calls.  Too
  much done here to talk about, but part of it was moving 
  the site configuration to a flat file.  These changes
  should decrease the usage of the SQL server a great deal.
  This took up most of my day.
- Variable usage optimizations.  Made many, many chnages in
  the way variables were being used.  This should result in
  cleaner, faster code that _may_ use a little less memory?
  Hey, if I can save 2k per hit, thats a big deal! :-)
- Updated all code and tested to ensure php4 compatibility.
  So from now on only php4 will be run on the Geeks web
  servers.  So I changed all the extentions and links from
  .php3 to .php to mark this moment.
- Restructured the directory layout so I can implement some
  new security settings on the files.  Hmmm, I bet you 
  wondering "what is this mad-man thinking?"

June 17, 2000
-------------

- Initial announcement, running this new code on the Geeks
  web servers.
- Special thanks to Jason Hines and phpWebLog! His work 
  inspired much of my efforts!  Unfortunatly phpWebLog is 
  taking a different direction that the Geeks sites needed.
  However, all the code I am writing here will be published
  in the hopes that Jason and others may find these functions
  useful.  If you looking for a weblog software that is cool,
  configurable and supported by someone I would recommend you
  check out http://phpweblog.org and party on dudes!
