<h1>Support options</h1>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The very documentation you're currently reading includes information about <a href="install.html">installing</a> and <a href="install.html#upgrade">upgrading</a> Geeklog, and it also lists <a href="install.html#installprob">common problems</a> and their solution. Detailed information about the <a href="config.html">configuration</a> is also available, as is information about <a href="theme.html">themes</a> and how to <a href="theme.html#changes">update</a> them.</p>

<p>Further information about using Geeklog can be found in our ever-expanding <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/">Documentation Wiki</a>, maintained by the Geeklog community.</p>

<p>The most frequently asked questions are covered in our <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/">FAQ</a> - see if you can find the answer to your question there.</p>

<p>Still can't find what you're looking for? Try <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/search.php">searching</a> the Geeklog Homepage. Chances are that someone already had the same question or problem and it has been covered there before.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> If you're trying to resolve an error message you're getting, try searching for that error message first.</p>


<h2>Interactive Help</h2>

<h3>Forums</h3>

<p>The best place to ask your questions are the <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/forum/">forums</a> on the Geeklog Homepage. Many Geeklog users frequent the forums, so you'll usually get a quick response there.</p>

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>If you prefer email, there are also several <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/index.php?op=view&amp;t=15">mailing lists</a> that you can use. Questions regarding installing and running Geeklog are best posted on the <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-users">geeklog-users</a> mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please note that due to the ever-increasing amount of spam, you have to subscribe to the mailing lists before you can post there. <strong>Posts by non-subscribers are silently discarded</strong>, so make sure to subscribe first.</p>

<h3>IRC</h3>

<p>Want to meet the Geeklog developers and other Geeklog users? Join us on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/geeklog">IRC</a>: channel #geeklog on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<p>If you don't have an IRC client, you can also use the web-based <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/staticpages/index.php/irc-chat">IRC chat</a> option on <tt>geeklog.net</tt>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The channel is often very quiet. It's usually best to "just ask your question" and be willing to wait a bit for a response.</p>


<h2>Other Options</h2>

<h3>Bug Reports and Feature Requests</h3>

<p>Found a bug? <a href="http://project.geeklog.net/tracking/">Submit a bug report</a> on our project website. Of course, you can also submit feature requests or <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/Submitting_Patches">patches</a>
there.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before submitting a new bug report or feature request, please do a search first (on the project site as well as on the Geeklog Homepage) to make sure it hasn't been covered before. Thanks.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Want to develop a plugin or some other add-on? Read the <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/Plugin_Developers_Handbook">Plugins Developer's Guide</a> and join the <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-modules">geeklog-modules</a> and <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-devel">geeklog-devel</a> mailing lists.</p>

<p>Want to help in Geeklog development? Here's an <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/Getting_Started">article on how to get started</a>. It has pointers to all the resources you need to know about.</p>

<h3>Paid Support</h3>

<h2>Security Issues</h2>

<p>The Geeklog developers take security very seriously. Should you need to report a security issue with Geeklog, please email details to <a href="mailto:geeklog-security@lists.geeklog.net" rel="nofollow">geeklog-security(at)lists.geeklog.net</a>. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Posts to geeklog-security are of course <em>not</em> discarded and you don't need to (and can't, actually) subscribe to this list. Simply send an email to this address and we will get back to you ASAP.</p>

<p>Also see our <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/staticpages/index.php/GeeklogSecurity">Security statement</a> on the Geeklog Homepage.</p>


<h2>Staying up to date</h2>

<p>The best way to stay up to date with Geeklog development and being informed
of new releases and other important news (such as security issues), is to
subscribe to the <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-announce">geeklog-announce</a> mailing list. This is a low-traffic mailing list and
is really only used for important announcements.</p>

<p>On the Geeklog Homepage, we also provide a variety of RSS feeds that you can
subscribe to.</p>

<p>Geeklog also has a built-in feature to check for updates. Simply click on
the <strong>GL Version Test</strong> link (an entry in your Admin menu) to
see if your install is up to date.</p>


<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>If you consider Geeklog to be useful, feel free to <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/index.php?op=view&amp;t=49">make a donation</a>. Thank you!</p>
