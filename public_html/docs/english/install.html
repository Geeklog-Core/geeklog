<h2><a name="glossary">Glossary</a></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Directory: Same as a folder.</li>
        <li>Path: A physical location on a server that describes where files and directories are. On Windows paths begin with the drive letter (<code>c:/inetpub/wwwroot/</code>), on *nix paths start at root (<code>/</code>) like (<code>/var/www/</code>)</li>
        <li><a name="public_html">public_html</a>: Common name for the directory on a webserver that contains all files that are accessible via a URL (other common names: htdocs, www)</li>
        <li>URL: Uniform Resource Locator, the address of a specific piece of information on the web (<code>http://www.foo.com/</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    

<h2><a name="installation_requirements">Installation Requirements</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="preinstall">Required Software</a></h3>

        <p>To install and use Geeklog you will need to have a server running Apache or Microsoft IIS with PHP 4.3.0 or higher installed. You will also need either <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">MySQL 4.0.18</a> or later, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/">PostgreSQL</a> 7 or greater (7.4 or later recommended), or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/">Microsoft SQL Server 2000</a> or newer.</p>

    <h3><a name="things_you_should_know">Things You Should Know</a></h3>

    <p>Before installing Geeklog for the first time, please make sure you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know how to determine the path of your root web directory. (<a href="#glossary">What is a path?</a>)
        <li>Have the ability to unpack the downloaded Geeklog tarball file.
        <li>Have the ability to create a new database or have access to an existing one.
        <li>Have access to your web server via SSH or FTP so you can change permissions on a few files and directories.
    </ul>
    

<h2><a name="install">New Installation</a></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Download the current version of Geeklog from <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">Geeklog.net</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Unpack the downloaded tarball file by running: </p>
            <p><code>tar -zxvf geeklog-1.8.0.tar.gz</code> </p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some users have reported that WinZip corrupts certain Geeklog files during decompression. This will cause errors during the installation process. You are strongly urged not to use WinZip. Try <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> if you must decompress the file locally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Create a blank MySQL or Microsoft SQL database and a user account with privileges to modify it. Your hosting provider may have already set up a database and account for you, contact them if you need assistance with this step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place the contents of <code>geeklog-1.8.0/public_html/</code> into your web root directory on your web server. The web root directory is often named "public_html", "htdocs", or "www".</p>
        
            <p>Next, place the remaining contents of <code>geeklog-1.8.0/</code> into either the parent directory of your root web directory (recommended) or any other non public folder and the installation wizard will attempt to locate them automatically. If it cannot you will be asked to specify their paths during installation. This is done as a security measure to prevent access to Geeklog system files by Internet users. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If your hosting provider does not allow you to place files outside of your root web directory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an inconspicuous directory (i.e. don't name it "geeklog") in your root web directory.</li>
                <li>Place these system files in that directory.</li>
                <li>Password protect it using an .htaccess file or similar.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Open your browser and navigate to the Geeklog installation wizard file <code>admin/install/index.php</code> on your web server. The path to this file will depend on where you chose to put the Geeklog files on your web server. The default location is: </p>
            
            <p><code>http://[your_geeklog_site]/admin/install/index.php</code></p>
            
            <p>The Geeklog installation wizard was designed to automate the install process. Simply follow the installation steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once you have completed the installation be sure to delete the <code>admin/install</code> directory. Also, read the first story on your Geeklog site to learn how to log in as the administrator and change the default password.<br>
</p>
        </li>        
    </ol>
   

<h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrading</a></h2>

    <p>Upgrading is no different than a New Installation except your database already exists and needs to be updated.</p> 

    <p>Take extreme care to back up any files from your current Geeklog installation that have any custom code in them, especially lib-custom.php (where all custom code should reside). Be sure to back up any modified themes, images, and static pages from your current installation.</p>
            
    <p>Also, please be sure to back up your database. We can't stress the importance of backing up your files and database enough. </p>

    <p><strong>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Download the current version of Geeklog from <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">Geeklog.net</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Unpack the downloaded tarball file by running: </p>
            <p><code>tar -zxvf geeklog-1.8.0.tar.gz</code> </p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some users have reported that WinZip corrupts certain Geeklog files during decompression. This will cause errors during the installation process. You are strongly urged not to use WinZip. Try <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> if you must decompress the file locally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place the contents of <code>geeklog-1.8.0/</code> into the same directory your old installation was located. For instance, if your old Geeklog was in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>, then your new installation should also be in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Depending on the version you're upgrading from:
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>When upgrading from Geeklog 1.4.1 or earlier</strong>: Put the <tt>config.php</tt> files from your old install back into their place now (the main <tt>config.php</tt> and those for the plugins). The install script will read these files during the upgrade to pre-populate the new Configuration admin panel with your settings. If you skip this step, you will end up with default settings for Geeklog and the pre-installed plugins.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>When upgrading from Geeklog 1.5.0 or later</strong>: Put the <tt>db-config.php</tt> and <tt>siteconfig.php</tt> from your old install back into their place now, overwriting the files of the same name that came in the tarball. Otherwise, you would have to enter your database credentials and other information during the upgrade process again.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Open your browser and navigate to the Geeklog installation wizard file <code>admin/install/index.php</code> on your web server. The path to this file will depend on where you chose to put the Geeklog files on your web server. The default location is: </p>
            
            <p><code>http://[your_geeklog_site]/admin/install/index.php</code></p>
            
            <p>The Geeklog installation wizard was designed to automate the upgrade process. Simply follow the installation steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once you have completed the upgrade be sure to delete the <code>admin/install</code> directory.</p>
        </li>        
    </ol>
   
<h2><a name="migrate">Migrating</a></h2>

<p>The install script's "Migrate" option will help you move your site to another server or domain name. It will update the configuration information stored in the database and can also update URLs in content, such as articles (in case the domain name or URL of your Geeklog site changed).</p>

<p>After clicking on "Migrate", you will have to enter the database credentials for your (new) database server, as usual. Note that you don't need to enter a table prefix, as the Migrate option will detect it automatically.</p>

<p>You then have the option to upload a database backup from your computer, to import from a backup that's already on the server (in Geeklog's <tt>backups</tt> directory), or you can use the current content of the database, in case you already imported it through other means.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Uploading a backup file from your computer will only work as long as the size of the backup file is below the server's max. upload limit. The max. allowed size will be displayed when you select this option. If your backup file is over that limit, try compressing it (zip or gzip should work) or use one of the other two options.</p>

<h2><a name="installprob">Common Problems and Troubleshooting</a></h2>

    <p>Before you go any further, please open siteconfig.php and <strong>double check your paths!</strong> Bad paths, or typos in the paths, will cause all sorts of errors in Geeklog.</p>   

<p>When you get an error message, please read it carefully. Even if you're not familiar with PHP, it will give you a hint about what is wrong. Pay special attention at the paths contained in the error message. As mentioned before, wrong paths are the most common cause for problems.</p>

<p>If you get more than one error message, always start with the very first error - the others will often go away automatically once you've fixed the first one.</p>

    <h3>Common errors (Line numbers will vary):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>Parse error: parse error in /path/to/your/siteconfig.php on line 20</code></p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A parse error usually hints at a typo you've made. Check the file at the given line (the actual error may be in the line preceding the one mentioned in the error message).</p>
                <p>Common problems are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>not enclosing paths in single quotes properly</li>
                    <li>missing semicolon at the end of the line</li>
                    <li>using single quotes within a string (you need to write <code>Joe's Site</code> as <code>Joe\'s Site</code>, escaping the extra quote)
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>Warning: main(some/path/to/system/databases/mysql.class.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/your/system/lib-database.php on line 100</code></p>
                <p><code>Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'some/path/to/system/databases/mysql.class.php' (include_path='.:/some/other/path/') in /some/path/to/system/lib-database.php on line 100</code></p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The path that you've entered for the <code>$_CONF['path']</code> variable in siteconfig.php is not correct. Make sure you typed it correctly. Also make sure it uses an <em>absolute</em> path, i.e. one that starts at the root of your file system (and that it starts with a / under Unix/Linux or a drive letter under Windows).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>1050: Table 'gl_access' already exists</code></p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You must have run the install script once before (possibly unsuccessfully). To be on the safe side, drop the database and create a new, empty database and try running the install script again.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>Parse error: parse error in ../../lib-common.php on line 2231 </code></p>
                <p><code>Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: template in ../../lib-common.php on line 335 </code></p>

                <p>Or:</p>
                <p><code>Parse error: parse error in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/lib-common.php on line 3036</code></p>
                <p><code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function: plg_showcenterblock() in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/index.php on line 67</code></p>

                <p>Or:</p>
                <p><code>Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/lib-common.php on line 3815</code></p>
                <p><code>Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: template in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/lib-common.php on line 709</code></p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> All of the above cases (and similar "parse error" messages you may get for lib-common.php, typically with a line number in the 3000 or 4000 range) indicate a corrupted <code>lib-common.php</code> file.</p>
                <p>As noted at the top of this document this is usually caused by one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncompressing the tarball with certain versions of WinZip (try using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> instead)</li>
                    <li>Editing the lib-common.php with Dreamweaver or other so-called WYSIWYG HTML editors (use a simple text editor instead)</li>
                    <li>Editing the lib-common.php with "on-site" text editors built into tools like Cpanel (again, use a simple text editor instead)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>Warning: mysql_connect(): Access denied for user: 'username@localhost' (Using password: YES) in /path/to/geeklog/system/databases/mysql.class.php on line 104<br>
Cannnot connect to DB server</code></p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> First of all, make sure the database settings in <code>siteconfig.php</code> are correct, specifically the name and password of your MySQL user, the name of your database, and the name of your MySQL server.</p>

                <p>If you're running your own server, you may need to give your MySQL user proper permissions. Log in to MySQL as the MySQL root user and issue these commands:</p>

                <p><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <em>[database_name]</em> TO <em>[user@host]</em> IDENTIFIED BY '<em>[password]</em>';<br>
                FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</code></p>
                
                <p>Replace the <em>[lower-case]</em> strings with the actual values.</p>
                
                <p>If you want (or need) to be more restrictive with database permissions: You will need to at least grant the ALTER, CREATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE permissions to your database user. ALTER and CREATE permissions are only needed for installing and upgrading Geeklog, as well as for installing plugins and other add-ons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Error:</strong> <code>Warning: fopen("/some/path/logs/error.log", "a") - Permission denied in /some/path/public_html/lib-common.php on line 1440</code></p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Make sure that the logs/ directory has the permissions set to at least 755 AND the files in it have permissions of at least 644. You may need to make the permissions 775 or 777 and 664 or 666 (respectively) if 755 and 644 isn't working for you. For good measure, make sure the <code>public_html/backend</code> directory and the geeklog.rss file have the same permissions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Whenever someone tries to log in or out, the following error is produced:</strong></p>
                <p><code>Cannot add header information - headers already sent by (output started at /usr###/home/&lt;userid&gt;/public_html/geeklog/siteconfig.php:589) in /usr###/home/&lt;userid&gt;/public_html/geeklog/system/lib-sessions.php on line 133</code></p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Make sure that your siteconfig.php file does not contain any "whitespace" after the closing <code>?&gt;</code> at the end of the file. I.e. there should not be anything (not even blanks or empty lines) after those two characters.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you still have problems, please do one or more of the following:</p>
