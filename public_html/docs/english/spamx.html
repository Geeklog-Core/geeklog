<h1>Geeklog Spam-X Plugin</h1>

<p><small>(If you came here looking for Hendrickson Software Components' email spam filter of the same name, please <a href="http://www.hendricom.com/spamcontrol.htm" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.)</small></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Geeklog Spam-X plugin was created to fight the problem of comment spam
for Geeklog systems. If you are unfamiliar with comment spam you might see the
<a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/11/comment_spam_manifesto/">Comment Spam
Manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>Spam protection in Geeklog is mostly based on the Spam-X plugin, originally
developed by Tom Willet. It has a modular architecture that allows it to be
extended with new modules to fight the spammer's latest tricks, should the need
arise.</p>

<h2><a name="checked">What is being checked for spam?</a></h2>

<p>Geeklog and the Spam-X plugin will check the following for spam:</p>

<ul>
<li>Story submissions</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Trackbacks and Pingbacks</li>
<li>Event submissions</li>
<li>Link submissions</li>
<li>The text sent with the "Email story to a friend" option</li>
<li>Emails sent to users via the "send email" form from their profile page</li>
<li>A user's profile</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="modules">Module Types</a></h2>

<p>The Spam-X plugin was built to be expandable to easily adapt to changes the
comment spammers might make.  There are three types of modules: <a
href="#examine">Examine</a>, <a href="#action">Action</a>, and <a
href="#admin">Admin</a>. A new module is contained in a file and can simply be
dropped in and it will be added to the plugin.</p>

<h2><a name="examine">Examine Modules</a></h2>

<p>Geeklog ships with the following examine modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#slv">Spam Link Verification (SLV)</a></li>
<li><a href="#personal">Personal Blacklist</a></li>
<li><a href="#ip">IP Filter</a></li>
<li><a href="#ipofurl">IP of URL Filter</a></li>
<li><a href="#header">HTTP Header Filter</a></li>
<!-- <li><a href="#honeypot">Project Honeypot Filter</a></li> -->
</ul>

<h3><a name="slv">Spam Link Verification (SLV)</a></h3>

<p>SLV is a centralized, server-based service that examines posts made on
websites and detects when certain links show up in unusually high numbers. In
other words, when a spammer starts spamming a lot of sites with the same URLs
and those sites all report to SLV, the system will recognize this as a spam
wave and will flag posts containing these URLs as spam.</p>

<p>In other words still, it's a dynamic blacklist that automatically updates
itself when a spammer starts spamming for their site. And it can only get
better (in terms of accuracy and reaction speed) the more sites use it.</p>

<p>SLV is a free service run by Russ Jones at <a
href="http://www.linksleeve.org/">www.linksleeve.org</a>.

<p><strong><a name="slvprivacy">Privacy Notice:</a></strong>
It should be stressed that using SLV means that information from your site
is being sent to a third party's site. In some legislations you may have to
inform your users about this fact - please check with your local privacy
laws.</p>

<p>Sending information to an external site may also be undesirable on some
setups, e.g. on a company intranet. You can disable SLV support by removing the
four files <tt>SLV.Examine.class.php</tt>, <tt>SLVbase.class.php</tt>,
<tt>SLVreport.Action.class.php</tt>, and <tt>SLVwhitelist.Admin.class.php</tt>
 from your Spam-X directory (<tt>/path/to/geeklog/plugins/spamx</tt>). Or you
can simply disable the Spam-X plugin entirely (or uninstall it).</p>

<p>The SLV Examine and Action modules will extract all URLs from a post and
only send those to SLV (i.e. the rest of the post's content is not being sent).
They also remove any links that contain your Geeklog site's URL. In case a post
does not contain any external links, the modules simply do not contact SLV at
all.</p>


<h3><a name="personal">Personal Blacklist</a></h3>

<p>The Personal Blacklist module lets you add keywords and URLs that typically
exist in spam posts. When you're being hit by spam, make sure to add the URLs
of those spam posts to your Personal Blacklist so that they can be filtered out
automatically, should the spammer try to post them again.</p>

<p>This will also help you get rid of spam that made it through, as you can
then use the Mass Delete Comments and Mass Delete Trackbacks modules to easily
remove large numbers of spam posts from your database.</p>

<p>The Personal Blacklist also has an option to import the Geeklog <a
href="config.html#desc_censorlist">censor list</a> and ban all comments which
contain one of those words. This or an expanded list might be useful for a
website that caters to children. Then no comments with offensive language could
be posted.</p>

<h3><a name="ip">IP Filter</a></h3>

<p>Sometimes you will encounter spam that is coming from one or only a few IP
addresses. By simply adding those IP addresses to the IP Filter module, any
posts from these IPs will be blocked automatically.</p>

<p>In addition to single IP addresses, you can also add IP address ranges,
either in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR" title="Classless Inter-Domain Routing">CIDR</a> notation or as simple <i>from</i>-<i>to</i> ranges.</p>

<p>Please note that IP addresses aren't really a good filter criterion. While
some ISPs and hosting services are known to host spammers, it won't help much
to block an IP address by one of the well-known ISPs. Often, the spammer will
get a new IP address the next time he connects to the internet, while the
blocked IP address will be reused and may be used by some innocent user.</p>

<h3><a name="ipofurl">IP of URL Filter</a></h3>

<p>This module is only useful in a few special cases: Here you enter the IP
address of a webserver that is used to host domains for which you may see spam.
Some spammers have a lot of their sites on only a few webservers, so instead of
adding lots of domains to your blacklist, you only add the IP addresses of
those webservers. The Spam-X module will then check all the URLs in a post to
see if any of these is hosted on one of those blacklisted webservers.</p>

<h3><a name="header">HTTP Header Filter</a></h3>

<p>This module lets you filter for certain HTTP headers. Every HTTP request
sent to your site is accompanied by a series of headers identifying, for
example, the browser that your visitors uses, their preferred language, and
other information.</p>

<p>With the Header filter module, you can block HTTP requests with certain
headers. For example, some spammers are using Perl scripts to send their spam
posts. The user agent (browser identification) sent by Perl scripts is usually
something like "libwww-perl/5.805" (the version number may vary). So to block
posts made by this user agent, you would enter:</p>

<table border="0" style="width:15em">
<tr><td><b>Header:</b></td><td align="left"><kbd>User-Agent</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Content:</b></td><td align="left"><kbd>^libwww-perl</kbd></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This would block all posts from user agents beginning with "libwww-perl".</p>

<h3><a name="honeypot">Project Honeypot http:BL Filter</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org" title="visit the project honey pot site">ProjectHoneypot.org</a>
    is a new service providing a way of trapping malicious web users with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_%28computing%29" title="view the wikipedia definition of a Honeypot">honeypots</a>.
    Essentially this provides traps for email address harvesting bots, spammers,
    and people trying to exploit web sites. Using the honeypots, the project
    gathers and maintains an active blacklist of IP addresses categorised by
    threat type, level and activity.</p>

<p>With the ProjectHoneyPot filter module, you can block posts from known bad
    ip addresses as identified by the <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php">http:BL</a>
    blacklist.
    </p>
    <p>In order to do so, you must first <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/create_account.php">Register with projectHoneyPot</a>,
        <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/manage_honey_pots.php">install a honeypot</a> or
        <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/manage_quicklink.php">quick link</a> and
        <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php">get an access key</a>
        for the http:BL.</p>
    <p>Once you have done this, and inserted appropriate details into the Spam-X
        config.php file, http:BL blocking will be used for all filtered content
    automatically.</p>

<h2><a name="action">Action Modules</a></h2>

<p>Once one of the <a href="#examine">examine modules</a> detects a spam post,
the action modules will decide what to do with the spam. Most of the time, you
will simply want to delete the post then, so this is what the <b>Delete
Action</b> module does.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the <b>Mail Admin Action</b> module sends an email to
the site admin when a spam post is encountered. Since this can cause quite a
lot of emails being sent, it is disabled by default.</p>

<p>Action modules have to be enabled specifically before they are used (examine
modules, on the other hand, are activated by simply dropping them into the
Spam-X directory). For this, every action module has a unique number that needs
to be added up with the number of the other action modules you want to enable
and entered as the value for the <a href="config.html#desc_spamx">spamx config
variable</a> in Geeklog's main configuration.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The Delete Action module has the value 128, while the Mail Admin Action
module has the value 8. So to activate both modules, add 128 + 8 = 136 and
enter that in the Configuration admin panel.</p>

<p>The SLV Examine module is complemented by a <strong>SLV Action</strong>
module that ensures that SLV is notified of spam posts caught by other examine
modules. It "piggybacks" on the Delete Action module, i.e. when you activate
the Delete Action module, you'll also enable the SLV Action module.</p>


<h2><a name="admin">Admin Modules</a></h2>

<p>The Admin modules for the <a href="#personal">Personal Blacklist</a>, <a
href="#ip">IP Filter</a>, <a href="#ipofurl">IP of URL Filter</a>, and <a
href="#header">HTTP Header Filter</a> modules provide you with a form to add
new entries. To delete an existing entry, simply click on it.</p>

<p>With the <strong>SLV Whitelist</strong> admin module you can add URLs that
you don't want to be reported to SLV. This is useful when posts on your site
happen to contain certain URLs quite often but you don't want those to be
considered spam by SLV.<br>Note that your site's URL (i.e. <a
href="config.html#desc_site_url">$_CONF['site_url']</a>) is automatically
whitelisted, so you don't need to add it here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Log View</strong> module lets you inspect and clear the Spam-X
logfile. The logfile contains additional information about the spam posts, e.g.
which IP address they came from, the user id (if posted by a logged-in user),
and which of the examine modules caught the spam post.</p>

<p>In case a large number of spam posts made it through without being caught,
the <strong>Mass Delete Comments</strong> and <strong>Mass Delete
Trackbacks</strong> modules will help you get rid of them easily. Before you
use these modules, make sure to add the URLs or keywords from those spams to
your Personal Blacklist.</p>

<h2><a name="mt-blacklist">Note about MT-Blacklist</a></h2>

<p>MT-Blacklist was a blacklist, i.e. a listing of URLs that were used in spam
posts, originally developed for Movable Type (hence the name) and maintained by
Jay Allen.</p>

<p>Maintaining a blacklist is a lot of work, and you're continually playing
catch-up with the spammers. Therefore, Jay Allen eventually <a
href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued">discontinued
MT-Blacklist</a> on the assumption that new and better methods to detect spam
are now available.</p>

<p>Starting with Geeklog 1.4.1, Geeklog no longer uses MT-Blacklist. All
MT-Blacklist entries are removed from the database when you upgrade to
Geeklog 1.4.1 and the MT-Blacklist examine and admin modules are no longer
included.</p>

<h2><a name="trackback">Trackback Spam</a></h2>

<p><a href="trackback.html">Trackbacks</a> are also run through Spam-X before
they will be accepted by Geeklog. There are also some additional checks that
can be performed on trackbacks: Geeklog can be configured to check if the site
that supposedly sent the trackback actually contains a link back to your site.
In addition, Geeklog can also check if the IP address of the site in the
trackback URL matches the IP address that sent the trackback. Trackbacks that
fail any of these tests are usually spam. Please refer to the <a
href="config.html#desc_check_trackback_link">documentation for the
configuration</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="config.php">Configuration</a></h2>

<p>The Spam-X plugin's configuration can be changed from the Configuration admin
panel:</p>

<h3><a name="main">Spam-X Main Settings</a></h3>

<table>
<tr><th style="width:25%">Variable</th>
    <th style="width:25%">Default Value</th>

  <td>The Spam-X plugin will filter posts by any user - even site admins. This

    <code>true</code> then posts made by users in the 'spamx Admin' group are
    not checked for spam.</td>

  <td>128</td>
  <td>This only exists as a fallback in case <a
    href="config.html#desc_spamx">$_CONF['spamx']</a> in Geeklog's main

    precedence.</td>
