<h1>Geeklog Spam-X Plugin</h1>

<p><small>(If you came here looking for Hendrickson Software Components' email spam filter of the same name, please <a href="http://www.hendricom.com/spamcontrol.htm" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.)</small></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Geeklog Spam-X plugin was created to fight the problem of comment spam
for Geeklog systems. If you are unfamiliar with comment spam you might see the
<a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/11/comment_spam_manifesto/">Comment Spam
Manifesto</a>.</p>

<h2>MT-Blacklist</h2>

<p>The main mechanism Spam-X uses to fight comment spam is to use the blacklist 
created by Jay Allen and Movable Type users - MT-Blacklist.  You can find out
info about this project at <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/">http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/</a>. Jay has taken
it upon himself not only to write and support the plugin for Movable Type but
also to maintain the blacklist.  This requires human effort to review all the
submissions and determine which are really spam and which are just noise.  If
you have a few extra bucks drop by Jay's website above and drop a few dollars
in his PayPal account to show your appreciation.</p>

<p>The MT-Blacklist theory is that comment spammers do it to increase their
Google rankings and therefore the link is all important.  The MT-Blacklist
therefore only filters on urls.</p>

<h2>Other options</h2>

<p>The MT-Blacklist is only one part of the Geeklog Spam-X plugin however.  The
Spam-X plugin has its own personal blacklist that you can add to. You can
use it to filter anything from comments.  One option is to import the Geeklog
<a href="config.html#desc_censorlist">censor list</a> and ban all comments
which contain one of those words.  This or an expanded list might be usefull
for a website that caters to children.  Then no comments with offensive
language could be posted.</p>

<h2>Module types</h2>

<p>The Spam-X plugin was built to be expandable to easily adapt to changes the
comment spammers might make.  There are three types of modules: <b>admin</b>,
<b>examine</b> and <b>action</b>.  A new module is contained in a file and can
simply be dropped in and it will be added to the plugin.  The modules with
which the plugin ships are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Admin
    <ul>
      <li>View Spam-X log</li>
      <li>Update MT-Blacklist</li>
      <li>Edit Personal Blacklist</li>
      <li>Edit IP Of Spammer Blacklist</li>
      <li>Edit IP Of Link Blacklist</li>
      <li>Mass Delete Comments</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Examine
    <ul>
      <li>MT-Blacklist</li>
      <li>Personal Blacklist</li>
      <li>IP of Spammer</li>
      <li>IP of Link</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Action
    <ul>
      <li>Delete Comment if on Blacklist</li>
      <li>Mail Admin if Comment Rejected</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Other modules can be just dropped into place and they will become
available to the plugin.  To remove a module just
delete it from the spamx directory or rename it.  Planned modules include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Admin
    <ul>
      <li>Comparing MT-Blacklist and personal blacklist to eliminate
          duplications</li>
      <li>Parsing comments and automatic adding spam links</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Examine
    <ul>
      <li>Specialized blacklists.  (These are in planning stages)</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Action
    <ul>
      <li>Save comment for review</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Action modules are each assigned a number and the actions taken when a
spam comment is found can be designated by a configuration variable.  Note:
the spamx interface has been generalized and can be called by other modules
and plugins.  See the developer docs for details.</p>
