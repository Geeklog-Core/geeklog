<h1>Changes</h1>

<p>This document is intended to give a quick overview over the most import
and / or obvious changes. For a detailed list of changes, please consult the
<a href="history">ChangeLog</a>. The file <tt>docs/changed-files</tt> has a list
of files that have been changed since the last release.</p>

<h2><a name="changes138">Geeklog 1.3.8</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<p>Geeklog 1.3.8 Includes the <strong>Static Pages 1.3 plugin</strong> which
replaces <em>both</em> the Static Pages 1.1 and 1.2 plugins. See the <a
href="staticpages.html">Static Pages documentation</a> for details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The search function has been rewritten. You can now search for the
    exact phrase, all the words, or any of the words from a query. Search
    words are also highlighted in stories.
  <li>New Privacy options: Users can decide whether they want to receive
    email from other users and/or admins and whether they want to show up in
    the Who's Online block.
  <li>You can now get a list of all users who are in a certain group (from the
    Admin's group editor).
  <li>When scaling is configured for images in stories, you can now keep the
    unscaled image (has to be enabled in config.php first). In that case, the
    scaled-down image in the story will serve as a thumbnail and link to the
    unscaled image.
  <li>You can now make one topic the default topic. The topic selection in the
    story submission form will then default to that topic. However, when
    browsing by topic (index.php?topic=Geeklog etc.) new story submissions will
    default to the current topic.
  <li>You can give your users the ability to change their username and delete
    their account. Both features have to be enabled in config.php.
  <li>Extended Plugin API: Plugins can now display content in Geeklog's
    center area, add their own information to the user profile, and add
    information to the site's header (<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section).
  <li>There's a new API for custom registration forms.
  <li>There have been quite a few theme changes in order to move most larger
    portions of hard-coded HTML to template files and to give theme designers
    more control over the layout. Please consult the <a
    href="theme.html#changes">themes documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The "forgot password" function has been rewritten. Instead of resetting
    your old password and sending you a new one, you will now receive an
    email with a unique link in it. If you follow this link, you can enter a
    new password directly. Otherwise, you can simply ignore the email and your
    old password will remain valid.
  <li>Topic access was not always checked properly. If Story Admins report
    getting access denied messages after upgrading to 1.3.8, check your topic
    permissions carefully.
  <li>The poll editor let you enter one answer too many (i.e. when the max.
    number of answers was set to 10 you could actually enter 11). Please check
    your existing polls or you may lose the last answer if you exceeded the
    max. number of answers in a poll (adjust $_CONF['maxanswers'] accordingly,
    if necessary).
  <li>Geeklog should install and run again on old versions of MySQL
    (specifically, 3.22.xx). Please note that some of these old versions aren't
    even supported by MySQL AB any more and MySQL installs older than 3.23.54
    are having security issues.
</ul>

<h2><a name="changes137sr2">Geeklog 1.3.7sr2</a></h2>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>The purpose of this release is to fix the following security issues.
All users are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to upgrade to this version ASAP.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was possible to obtain valid session ids for every account on a Geeklog
    site, including the Admin account (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
<li>Using Internet Explorer, it was possible to upload an image with embedded
    PHP code and execute it (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
<li>Story permissions could override topic permissions, resulting in the display
    of stories to users who shouldn't have access to them (reported by Andrew
    Lawlor). This was already fixed with the new <tt>index.php</tt>, released
    2003-05-15.</li>
<li>Added a warning in <tt>config.php</tt> that adding any of the following
    tags to the list of allowable HTML can make the site vulnerable to
    scripting attacks:<br>
    <code>&lt;img&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;marquee&gt; &lt;script&gt;
          &lt;embed&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;iframe&gt;</code><br>
    (pointed out by Joat Dede).</li>
</ol>

<p>This update also includes fixes for the notorious "permission denied"
error messages that some users would get in the Admin area (e.g. when trying
to save a story and being "only" a user with Story Admin permissions).</p>

<p>The full 1.3.7sr2 tarball also includes various new and updated language
files (see the Changelog for details).</p>


<h2><a name="changes137sr1">Geeklog 1.3.7sr1</a></h2>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>The main purpose of this release is to fix the following security issues.
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to this version.</p>
<ol>
<li>Javascript code could be injected in the homepage field of a user's profile (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
<li>Javascript code could be injected in certain URLs to be used in a cross-site scripting attack (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
<li>Comments could be deleted by anybody if they knew the comment id (which is not normally visible).</li>
<li>A StoryAdmin could manipulate stories even if s/he did not have access to them (e.g. when s/he was not a member of a certain group). The same applied to Admins for events, links, polls, topics, and blocks (reported by Kobaz).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed possible causes for endless loops with the redirect in index.php: No redirect will be done if $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_HOST'] is not set. Also, the comparison of the configured and actual server name is not case-sensitive any more.</li>
<li>Fixed image resizing when using ImageMagick.</li>
<li>The new user notification email (introduced in Geeklog 1.3.7) was always
 sent out, even if 'user' was not listed in $_CONF['notification'].
<li>The Admin menu will now be displayed for users who have Admin access to plugins only, but not to one of the core Admin features.</li>
<li>The default for the daily digest is now back to "off", i.e. new users will not receive it automatically. To enable the daily digest for new users again, set $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault'] = 1 in config.php.</li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation and hard-coded links (version check, link to Geeklog in a site's footer) have been updated to point to <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">www.geeklog.net</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="changes137">Geeklog 1.3.7</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A notification email can now be sent when a new story, link, or event
    has been submitted or a new user has registered with the site (see the
    <a href="config.html#submission">submission settings</a> for details).<br>
    Please note that this feature doesn't tie in with Geeklog's security
    features - it's really more of a hack, since many people asked for this
    functionality.</li>
  <li>Following the "X stories in last 24 hours" link in the What's New block
    will now display just those new stories.</li>
  <li>User photos are now resized, just like images in stories (if the use
    of an image library is configured). The max. dimensions for user photos
    can be set with a separate set of config variables in
    <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
  <li>The plugin menu now lists all plugins which exist in the file system
    but haven't been installed yet. It also provides a link to the install
    script of those plugins for easy installation.</li>
  <li>Several new config variables have been added to config.php (notification,
    showfirstasfeatured, dateonly, timeonly, skip_preview, upcomingeventsrange,
    emailstoryloginrequired, hideemailicon, hideprintericon, hidenewstories,
    hidenewcomments, hidenewlinks, max_photo_width, max_photo_height,
    max_photo_size).  Please see the <a 
    href="config.html">config documentation</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Theme changes: Please consult the <a href="theme.html#changes">themes 
    documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added sanity checks in the Admin story editor to prevent the loss of all
    stories when using an incomplete language file (or when manipulating the
    URL).</li>
  <li>Fixed a nasty bug in lib-security.php that let any user with UserAdmin
    permissions change the Root user's password, thus effectively becoming
    root.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with blocks disappearing when they were set to
    "homeonly".</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with multiple [code] ... [/code] sections in stories
    and comments.</li>
  <li>Fixed double line spacing in [code] sections and HTML-formatted comments
    on PHP 4.2.0 and up.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with slashes and HTML entities in emails sent by
    Geeklog.</li>
  <li>Fixes and improvements to the plugin API.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="addindex">Speeding up Geeklog (a bit)</a></h3>

<p>If you're upgrading from 1.3.6 or older versions, you may want to run the
script called <tt>addindex.php</tt> that you will find in the <tt>install</tt>
directory. This script adds index fields to some of Geeklog's database tables
which should improve overall access times a bit.</p>

<p>This has been implemented as a separate script (and not as part of the
upgrade process of the install script) since it may take some time to run,
depending on how many users / stories / etc. you have in your database. Some
people may even run into timeouts, e.g. when their hosting service limits the
execution time of PHP scripts. If that happens to you - <strong>Don't 
Panic</strong>. Simply run the script again (and again and ...) until it
reports that it didn't add any fields to any tables.</p>

<p>Please note that you do <em>not</em> need to run this script if you're doing
a fresh install of Geeklog 1.3.7. A database created during a fresh install
already has the new index fields.</p>


<h2><a name="changes136">Geeklog 1.3.6</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Images in articles can now be resized automatically during upload
    (provided you have either ImageMagick or netpbm installed). See the
    <a href="config.html#image">configuration description</a> for details.</li>
  <li>The contents of a static page entitled "Frontpage" will be displayed
    before the first story on the front page of a Geeklog site. If the static
    page additionally carries the label "nonews", then it will completely
    replace the news on the front page.</li>
  <li>User submission queue: When activated (in <tt><a
    href="config.html#submission">config.php</a></tt>), new users will need to
    be approved by an admin before they receive their password.</li>
  <li>The submission queues can be switched off separately, either completely
    (in <tt><a href="config.html#submission">config.php</a></tt>) or only for
    certain groups of users (by using the new features story.submit,
    links.submit, and event.submit).</li>
  <li>When posting source code (e.g. PHP, HTML, ...), you can now use the
    [code] ... [/code] pseudo tags to enclose those portions of your posting
    that should be reproduced verbatim.</li>
  <li>The links section now uses a categorized and paged display (can be
    <a href="config.html#links">switched off</a> separately and even back to the
    pre-1.3.6 style listing).</li>
  <li>Anonymous users can now be <a href="config.html#login">blocked</a> from
    almost every part of the site (e.g. links section, site stats, ...), if
    needed.</li>
  <li>A Geeklog site can now be disabled easily (e.g. for maintenance) by
    setting a flag in <tt><a href="config.html#site">config.php</a></tt>.</li>
  <li>Theme changes: Please consult the <a href="theme.html#changes">themes 
    documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to ensure that permissions are taken into
    account properly (e.g. not revealing titles of stories that the user has no
    access to).</li>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to make sure that Geeklog can now be
    properly localized (provided you have a language file that is up to date
    and have chosen the proper <a href="config.html#locale">locale settings</a>
    for your country and language).</li>
  <li>The variable $_CONF['site_admin_url'] is now used properly so that you
    can rename Geeklog's <tt>admin</tt> directory if needed.</li>
  <li>New RDF parser will now import most (if not all) RDF news feeds
    properly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since there are a lot of new variables in <tt>config.php</tt>, it is
    recommended you start with a fresh copy of that file instead of copying
    over your old <tt>config.php</tt> from your previous installation.</li>
  <li>Please note that currently only the English, German, Italian, Polish,
    and Japanese language files are up to date. Using one of the other
    language files may result in your Geeklog site not working properly.</li>
</ul>
