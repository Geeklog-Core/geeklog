<h1>Changes</h1>

<p>This document is intended to give a quick overview over the most important
and / or obvious changes. For a detailed list of changes, please consult the
<a href="history">ChangeLog</a>. The file <tt>docs/changed-files</tt> has a list
of files that have been changed since the last release.</p>

<h2><a name="changes150">Geeklog 1.5.0</a></h2>

<h3>Results from the Summer of Code</h3>

<p>This release incorporates the following projects implemented during the
the 2007 Google Summer of Code:</p>

<ul>
<li>New user-friendly install script by Matt West</li>
<li>New Configuration GUI (replacing config.php) by Aaron Blankstein</li>
<li>New Webservices API based on the Atom Publishing Protocol by Ramnath R. Iyer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other New Features and Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>OpenID support: You can now allow users to log into your site using an
    OpenID, so that they don't need to create a new account with your site but
    still get all the benefits of a normal registered user.</li>
<li>New LDAP remote authentication module.</li>
<li>The Links plugin now has hierarchical (sub-)categories.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="http://fckeditor.net/">FCKeditor</a> to version 2.6.</li>
<li>Rewrite of the underlying story code. Amongst other things, this should
    finally resolve all outstanding issues with the handling of special
    characters, HTML entities, etc. in stories. Also introduces a new
    <code>[raw]</code> tag as an inline complement to <code>[code]</code> when
    you want to post pieces of code (e.g. HTML) "as is", so that they are not
    interpreted.</li>
<li>Comments can now be closed, i.e. existing comments will still be displayed
    but no new comment can be posted.</li>
<li>The Polls plugin now allows for multiple questions per poll.</li>
<li>The Static Pages plugin now supports comments.</li>
<li>The database backup admin panel now lets you delete and download
    backups.</li>
<li>The default Professional theme is now HTML 4.01 Strict compliant. Geeklog
    now also <a href="theme.html#xhtml">supports XHTML</a> (given an XHTML
    compliant theme).</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes141">Geeklog 1.4.1</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Support for Microsoft SQL Server. Starting with this release, Geeklog can
    now also be installed on Microsoft SQL Server, so it's no longer restricted
    to just MySQL. The MS SQL support was developed by Randy Kolenko.
    Thanks, Randy!<br>
    Please note that any third-party plugins will have to offer support for
    MS SQL before they can be installed on Microsoft SQL Server. The bundled
    plugins (Calendar, Links, Polls, Spam-X, Static Pages) have already been
    updated accordingly.</li>
<li><a href="calendar.html">Calendar plugin</a>. The formerly built-in calendar
    and events have now been moved into a separate plugin. This complements the
    move of the <a href="polls.html">polls</a> and <a href="links.html">links</a> sections into plugins in Geeklog 1.4.0 and makes Geeklog more modular as you
    can now easily disable or replace functionality that you don't need for
    your site.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/wiki/index.php/Multi-Language_Support">Multi-language support</a>. It is now possible to build truly multi-lingual sites
    with Geeklog where not only the navigation but also the content of the site
    changes with the language.</li>
<li>Ships with <a href="http://fckeditor.net/">FCKeditor</a> 2.3.1, which once
    again includes a file manager for uploading images.</li>
<li>A function for mass-deletion of old or inactive users. The list automatically
    searches for users that have never logged in, only used the site for a very
    short time or have not been online since a very long time. The time span can
    be varied, and found users can be selectively deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>In the light of the security issues discovered in Geeklog 1.4.0 and earlier
versions, the Geeklog source code has undergone a code review. We have
identified and addressed several minor issues and introduced new measures to
enhance security in this release. As a welcome side effect, the code reviews
have also uncovered a few bugs and inconsistencies that we also fixed in this
release.</p>

<h3>Spam Protection</h3>

<p>With this release we are finally removing support for the <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued">discontinued</a> MT-Blacklist. In its place, we are now using a system called Spam Link Verification (SLV) run by Russ Jones at <a href="http://www.linksleeve.org/">www.linksleeve.org</a>. SLV could be described as a community-driven, automatically updated blacklist. See the documentation of the <a href="spamx.html" rel="nofollow">Spam-X plugin</a> for details.</p>


<h2><a name="changes140sr5-1">Geeklog 1.4.0sr5-1</a></h2>

<p>This release fixes display problems in the comment preview that were only
introduced in Geeklog 1.4.0sr5.</p>


<h2><a name="changes140sr5">Geeklog 1.4.0sr5</a></h2>

<p>JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS" title="Click to look up 'XSS' on Wikipedia" style="text-decoration: none; color: black; border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">XSS</a> in the comment handling that we're fixing with this release.</p>


<h2><a name="changes140sr4">Geeklog 1.4.0sr4</a></h2>

<p>Two exploits have been released by "rgod" for insecure Geeklog installations and for a bug in the "mcpuk" file manager that we've been shipping as part of FCKeditor in all previous 1.4.0 releases.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of the files outside of the public_html directory were not protected
    against direct execution. If Geeklog was installed such that those files
    were accessible from a URL (which has always been strongly discouraged in
    the installation instructions) then those files could be used to load and
    execute malicious code from a remote server.
    <br><br>
    More information: <a
    href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/so-called-exploit">So-called
    Geeklog "exploit" posted</a>
    <br><br>
    In this release, we've added the missing execution prevention for all files
    outside of public_html. We would still, however, suggest that you fix your
    Geeklog install if the files outside of public_html are accessible from a
    URL (see our <a
    href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/index.php?op=view&amp;t=56">FAQ</a> for
    details).
</li>
<li>The "mcpuk" file manager that we've integrated into FCKeditor allowed the
    upload of arbitrary PHP code (even if FCKeditor was disabled in Geeklog's
    config.php). Depending on your webserver's configuration, it was then
    possible to execute that uploaded code.
    <br><br>
    More information: <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/exploit-for-fckeditor-filemanager">Exploit for FCKeditor's mcpuk file manager</a>
    <br><br>
    The file manager has been removed from this release. You will therefore no
    longer be able to upload files, e.g. images, through FCKeditor. Future
    versions of Geeklog will ship with an updated version of FCKeditor and its
    included file manager.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This release also includes the <a
href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/fighting-trackback-spam">updated
lib-trackback.php</a> for better protection against Trackback spam.</p>


<h2><a name="changes140sr3">Geeklog 1.4.0sr3</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Possible SQL injection and authentication bypass in <tt>auth.inc.php</tt>
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Possible XSS in <tt>getimage.php</tt>
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Path disclosure in <tt>getimage.php</tt> and the <tt>functions.php</tt> of
    some themes, e.g. the Professional theme
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Possible SQL injection in story submissions.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes140sr2">Geeklog 1.4.0sr2</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would
    allow anyone to log in as any user.</li>
<li>HTML was not stripped from the Location field in a user's profile.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes140sr1">Geeklog 1.4.0sr1</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>James Bercegay of GulfTech Security Research reported several issues with
    Geeklog's cookie handling that made it vulnerable to SQL injections,
    arbitrary file access, and even injection and execution of arbitrary
    code.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes140">Geeklog 1.4.0</a></h2>

<p><small>(Geeklog 1.4.0 was originally supposed to be called 1.3.12, so any
references you may find to a version 1.3.12 apply to version 1.4.0)</small></p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Geeklog now officially works with <code>register_globals = off</code>.
    Please note that some plugins may still require it to be <code>on</code>,
    though.</li>
<li>Added support for sending and receiving <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">Trackback</a> and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">Pingback</a> comments. Both
    are supported for stories, but there is also a new plugin API so that
    plugins can use this feature, too.  Trackback and Pingback can be disabled
    in <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to "ping" weblog directory services to advertise site
    updates (preconfigured to ping <a
    href="http://pingomatic.com">Ping-o-Matic</a>). As with Trackback and
    Pingback, this is supported for stories, but plugins can also make use of
    this feature via the plugin API.</li>
<li>New syndication framework so that Geeklog can now <strong>read and
    write</strong> feeds in different formats (currently supported: RSS, RDF,
    and Atom).</li>
<li>New administrator controlled user status. Including banning and
    administrator activation of accounts.</li>
<li>New Remote Authentication system to allow people with accounts on remote
    services such as Blogger.com or LiveJournal.com to login to your site
    without having to directly register on your site. (Remote accounts can be
    banned as normal accounts).</li>
<li>The Admin sections have been revamped to provide a more consistent look and
    sortable lists. "Command and Control" (<tt>moderation.php</tt>) now also
    comes with a new set of icons and has one icon for every Admin section.
    Furthermore, the Admin block and Command and Control can be <a
    href="config.html#desc_sort_admin">sorted</a> alphabetically.</li>
<li>Ships with <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/">FCKeditor</a> (WYSIWYG
    editor). To <a href="config.html#desc_advanced_editor">enable</a>, set
    <code>$_CONF['advanced_editor'] = true;</code> in your
    <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
<li>The search now only displays a specified amount of results per page to
    avoid running into timeouts when searching through large databases.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> Plugins will have to be updated to support the "paged" search.
    Until then, Geeklog fakes the paged results for plugin searches, which
    means that a plugin that hasn't been updated will still search through the
    entire database, but Geeklog will only display the results for the current
    result page.</li>
<li>Introduced an "Article Directory", providing an overview of all past
    articles, sorted by year and month.</li>
<li>The default permissions for new objects (stories, topics, blocks, etc.) can
    now be set in config.php.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
<li>Due to the changes, themes will have to be updated to work with Geeklog
    1.4.0. See the <a href="theme.html#changes">list of theme changes</a> for
    details.</li>
<li>The plugin API for comments has changed. Plugins using comments will have
    to be updated to work with Geeklog 1.4.0.</li>
</ul>

<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>We have posted a series of stories on the Geeklog homepage that highlight and explain some of the new features:</p>

<h2><a name="changes1311sr7">Geeklog 1.3.11sr7</a></h2>

<p>JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS" title="Click to look up 'XSS' on Wikipedia" style="text-decoration: none; color: black; border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">XSS</a> in the comment handling that we're fixing with this release.</p>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr6">Geeklog 1.3.11sr6</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Possible SQL injection and authentication bypass in <tt>auth.inc.php</tt>
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Possible XSS in <tt>getimage.php</tt>
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Path disclosure in <tt>getimage.php</tt> and the <tt>functions.php</tt> of
    some themes, e.g. the Professional theme
    (reported by the Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran).</li>
<li>Possible SQL injection in story submissions.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr5">Geeklog 1.3.11sr5</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would
    allow anyone to log in as any user.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr4">Geeklog 1.3.11sr4</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>James Bercegay of GulfTech Security Research reported several issues with
    Geeklog's cookie handling that made it vulnerable to SQL injections,
    arbitrary file access, and even injection and execution of arbitrary
    code.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr3">Geeklog 1.3.11sr3</a></h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provided you knew the story id, it was possible to submit comments for
    stories even if you did not have access to those stories
    (reported by LWC). The same problem also existed with poll comments.</li>
<li>Supplying an illegal start or end date to the advanced search resulted in a
    warning message that disclosed the path to the Geeklog install on the
    server (reported by r0t3d3Vil).<br>
    It was <strong>not</strong> possible to use this for SQL injections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also included in this release are bugfixes, e.g. for the problems editing
static pages when URL rewriting was enabled, that were introduced in
1.3.11sr2.</p>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr2">Geeklog 1.3.11sr2</a></h2>

<p>This release provides security enhancements and better spam protection
originally developed for Geeklog 1.3.12. It also addresses a few bugs where
the bugfix could be integrated with a reasonable amount of work (other bugfixes
will have to wait for the 1.3.12 release).

<h3>Security and Spam protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is now a speed limit for login attempts, defaulting to three tries
    in a five minute period (<a
    href="config.html#desc_login_attempts">configurable</a> in
    <tt>config.php</tt>).</li>
<li>Linefeeds are filtered from the To:, From:, and Subject: fields of any
    email sent through <code>COM_mail</code>.</li>
<li>When a new user account is created and the user submission queue is enabled
    in <tt>config.php</tt>, Geeklog now ensures that the new account is properly
    queued even in the unlikely event that the account creation fails halfway
    through.</li>
<li>When a post is identified as spam, it now also triggers the speed limit
    (ie. posters will have to wait for the speed limit to expire before they
    can make another submission).</li>
<li>Spam posts now get a 403 "Forbidden" HTTP response code.</li>
<li>Spam checks are now done for comments, story, link, and event submissions,
    the message sent with the "email story to a friend" option, and for the
    contents of the user profile.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/spam-x-1.0.2"
    rel="nofollow">Spam-X plugin 1.0.2</a> included.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that MT-Blacklist (used by Spam-X) has recently been <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued">discontinued</a>. The
Spam-X plugin as included in this release is configured to get the last version
of the blacklist from geeklog.net, but there will be no more updates.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error message thrown up by PHP 5.0.5 or later when viewing the
    article page (bug #483).</li>
<li>Quote names in email addresses as soon as they contain any non-alphanumeric
    characters, apart from the blank (bug #368). This should help when trying
    to email users with special characters in their name.</li>
<li>Upgraded included kses class to version 0.2.2 which fixes problems with
    Japanese and Thai characters (bugs #94 and #119).</li>
<li>Fixed SQL error when using the [staticpage:] autotag (bug #373).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list of bugfixes, please see the Changelog.</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for a <code>custom_usercheck</code> function (for the
    custom registration code). See the included <tt>lib-custom.php</tt> for
    details.</li>
<li>Improved handling of the auto-archive option in <tt>index.php</tt>, which
    should slightly improve page load times.</li>
<li>Includes several new and updated language files.</li>
<li>Includes updated PEAR classes.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1311sr1">Geeklog 1.3.11sr1</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stefan Esser found an SQL injection that can, under certain circumstances,
be exploited to extract user data such as the user's password hash.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="changes1311">Geeklog 1.3.11</a></h2>

<p>Geeklog 1.3.11 is a <strong>bugfix and security release</strong> over Geeklog 1.3.10 and is meant to replace 1.3.10. The change in the version number was necessary since one of the bugfixes involves a change in the database.</p>

<h3>Security issues</h3>
<ol>
<li>It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions
    were turned off in <tt>config.php</tt> (reported by Barry Wong).<br>
    These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you
    disabled it in <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
<li>Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered,
    leaving them open to potential SQL injections.</li>
<li>The links for the What's Related block were created from the unfiltered
    story text, opening the possibility of XSS attacks (reported by Vincent
    Furia).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixes the length of the 'sid' field in the gl_comments table. Using story
    IDs longer than 20 characters prevented comment posts from being associated
    with the story.</li>
<li>Ensures compatibility with PHP 4.1.x (includes updated PEAR packages).</li>
<li>Fixes the archiving option being activated too early (bug #345).</li>
<li>Properly deletes comments and story images when deleting entire topics
    (bug #339).</li>
<li>Deletes comments when deleting polls.</li>
<li>Fixes several bugs in the calendar and improves overall handling of both
    the site calendar and the personal calendars (bugs #268, #336, #338, and
    others).</li>
<li>Fixes "More by <i>author</i>" and "More from <i>topic</i>" links in
    articles.</li>
<li>Various other fixes, see <tt>docs/history</tt> for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>We strongly advise users of Geeklog 1.3.10 to upgrade to 1.3.11 ASAP. Upgrading should be relatively painless, as there weren't any changes in the themes, language files, or config.php over 1.3.10.</p>


<h2><a name="changes1310">Geeklog 1.3.10</a></h2>

<h3>New Default Theme</h3>

<p>This release comes with a new default theme: We've chosen the Professional
theme, kindly provided by Victor B. Gonzalez (of <a href="http://aeonserv.com">Aeonserv</a> fame). The theme has been modified slightly and is now fully HTML 4.01 and CSS compliant.</p>

<p>We've also decided to remove the old set of themes (Classic, Clean, Digital Monchrome, Gameserver, Smooth Blue, XSilver, Yahoo) from the distribution. They are now available as a separate tarball.</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="spamx.html" rel="nofollow">Spam-X plugin</a> included. Tom Willet
    has kindly provided his spam detection plugin, which is now part of the
    default Geeklog install.<br>
    The plugin has been modified slightly to store the blacklists in the
    database. Users of the previous version of the plugin will have to import
    their personal blacklist via the plugin's admin panel.</li>
<li>Story Archive feature: It is now possible to move stories to an "archive"
    topic or have them deleted automatically at a given time.</li>
<!-- li>PDF support: Stories can be converted into PDFs (requires installation
    of third-party software - see config.php for details).</li -->
<li>Customizable menu bar: The site's menu bar can now be <a
    href="config.html#desc_menu_elements">configured</a> in config.php, i.e.
    you can choose which entries should be displayed there and in which order.
    It's also possible to add custom entries by providing a function in
    lib-custom.php.</li>
<li>Clickable links in text postings: URLs in non-HTML postings are now
    recognized by Geeklog and displayed as clickable links.</li>
<li>Editable story IDs: The IDs of stories can now be changed (like the IDs of
    static pages) to provide more readable URLs (and further improve the
    chances of being picked up by seach engines, especially when used with
    URL rewriting).</li>
<li>Autolinks are a new form of links that can be used in stories and comments.
    An autolink takes the form
    <code>[<i>name</i>:<i>id</i> <i>link text</i>]</code> where <i>name</i> is
    the tag name, <i>id</i> is the ID of an object the link should be pointing
    to, and <i>link text</i> is used as the text of the link.<br>
    Example: <code>[story:email-bug About the email bug]</code> would be
    translated into <code>&lt;a href="http://example.com/article.php/email-bug"&gt;About the email bug&lt;/a&gt;</code><br>
    For the built-in autotags, the <i>link text</i> is optional and Geeklog
    will use the title of the object (story / event / static page) if it is not
    given.<br>
    Predefined autotags are <code>[story:]</code> to link to stories and
    <code>[event:]</code> to link to events. Plugins can define their own
    autotags to provide links to objects under their control. The Static Pages
    plugin already provides a <code>[staticpage:]</code> autotag.</li>
<li>Customizable welcome email: The email that is sent out to users
    registering with your site is now fully customizable by providing the
    text in a text file (/path/to/geeklog/data/welcome_email.txt).</li>
<li>Timezone hack: The popular "<a
    href="http://www.geeklog.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=40196">timezone
    hack</a>" is now included. It lets you set the site's timezone for when
    your server is located in another timezone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Various changes have been made to improve the overall performance.</li>
<li>On fresh installs, there is now an option to use InnoDB tables (instead of
    MyISAM) if your MySQL version supports them (as of MySQL 4.0, or 3.x "Max"
    builds). Existing databases can be converted to InnoDB by using the script
    <tt>admin/install/toinnodb.php</tt>.<br>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Using InnoDB tables makes database backups
    somewhat more complicated. Small and medium-sized sites should work just
    fine with MyISAM tables, so if in doubt <em>don't</em> use InnoDB
    tables.</li>
<li>The calendar's week can now either start on a Sunday or a Monday.</li>
<li>The Static Pages plugin now has an option to display a printer-friendly
    version of a static page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<ul>
<li>The comment code has undergone major changes to improve performance and
    add improvements like the ability to link to individual comments,
    paging comments, etc.</li>
<li>Users can now report abusive comments to the site admin.</li>
<li>The site admin can get an email notification when a new comment is
    posted (similar to the notification emails for new stories, links,
    events, and users).</li>
<li>The IP addresses of comment posters are now tracked and can be looked up
    directly by linking to a Whois service (or you can install Tom Willet's
    <a href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68255&amp;package_id=95743">NetTools</a>, which include a Whois function).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security-related fixes</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of the following bugs were problems with
Geeklog's permissions system and fall into the "information leakage" category,
i.e. under certain circumstances, site content was visible to persons who
shouldn't be able to see it. None of these bugs were exploitable in the sense
that they could be used to gain privileges or cause damage to Geeklog or the
environment it's running in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Group Admins were able to list the members of all groups, even if they were
    not members of those groups.</li>
<li>Group Admins were given a list of all the groups in the system, even if
    they were not members of those groups (bug #280).</li>
<li>Story and Event Admins were always given a list of all the stories / all
    the events, even when they didn't have read access to them (bug #269).</li>
<li>It was possible to request comments from stories even if the user didn't
    have permission to read the story (provided you knew both the story and
    the comment id).</li>
<li>Event permissions in the calendar's day and week view weren't checked
    properly, so that events may have been visible to users who shouldn't
    have been able to see them.</li>
<li>It was possible to add any event to the personal calender, even if you
    didn't have permissions to see it in the site calendar (provided you knew
    the event id).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Previewing and saving a story submission left the submitted story in the
    submission queue, but did additionally save it as a new story.</li>
<li>Deleting an event from the personal calendar didn't work (bug #199).</li>
<li>Old userphotos weren't removed when the new photo had a different file
    type, e.g. when changing from a .gif to a .jpg (bug #228).</li>
<li>Scaling images didn't work when the image exceeded the max. height but
    not the max. width (bug #242).</li>
<li>Keeping an unscaled image wasn't possible when using gdlib to rescale
    images (bug #197).</li>
<li>When using gdlib, GIF images were converted to PNG format, but Geeklog
    was still trying to display the GIF version. Since the LZW patent has
    now <a href="http://www.unisys.com/about__unisys/lzw">expired</a>, it is
    safe to use GIF images again and the PNG conversion has been dropped.</li>
<li>The tarball also includes updated PEAR packages which should address the
    email problems some users were having (bug #246).<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> These are the same PEAR packages that already
    shipped with Geeklog 1.3.9sr2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that there have also been <a href="theme.html#changes">theme
changes</a>, some of which are important to make the new features work (e.g.
the editable story IDs and the story archive options)!</p>

<p>This release contains various improvements provided by the Geeklog community
(see the <tt>docs/history</tt> file for proper credits). Thank you!</p>

<h2><a name="changes139sr3">Geeklog 1.3.9sr3</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions
    were turned off in <tt>config.php</tt> (reported by Barry Wong).<br>
    These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you
    disabled it in <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
<li>Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered,
    leaving them open to potential SQL injections.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes139sr2">Geeklog 1.3.9sr2</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the variable
    <code>$topic</code> in the language files (bug #293).</li>
<li>Prevent comment posts on stories or polls were comment posting has been
    disabled.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <tt>lib-plugins.php</tt> to work properly with PHP 5.</li>
<li>The complete tarball also includes updated PEAR packaged that fix
    some of the reported email problems.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes139sr1">Geeklog 1.3.9sr1</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was possible to post anonymous comments, even when anonymous comment
    posting had been switched off in config.php.<br>
    This bug was apparently exploited by spammers to send hundreds of spam
    posts to certain Geeklog sites.</li>
<li>Added additional speed limit checks for comments and submissions.</li>
<li>If none of the topics were visible for anonymous users, the site's index
    page may still have displayed some stories for anonymous users, depending
    on the stories' permissions.</li>
<li>Users still got Daily Digest emails for topics from which they had been
    removed (bug #178).</li>
<li>It was possible to subscribe to the Daily Digest for all topics, even if
    the user did not have access to certain topics.</li>
<li>Comments to stories were sometimes listed in a user's profile, even if the
    user viewing the profile didn't have permissions to access the story the
    comments belonged to.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an SQL error in <code>COM_showTopics</code> if users excluded topics
    from their preferences.</li>
<li>Fixed sporadic "Duplicate entry '...' for key 1." messages in error.log,
    caused by the handling of pseudo-session ids for anonymous users.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect author names in Daily Digest (bug #207).</li>
<li>The <code>plugin_profileblocksedit_<i>plugin-name</i></code> Plugin API
    function wasn't working due to a missing piece of code in
    usersettings.php.</li>
<li><code>COM_extractLinks</code> will now ignore anchor tags that do not
    contain "<code>href</code>" (bug #183).</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes139">Geeklog 1.3.9</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Geeklog now uses PEAR::Mail to send all emails. This gives you the option
    to send emails via PHP's built-in mail() function (as before), via
    sendmail or via SMTP.</li>
<li>There is a new admin option called Content Syndication that lets you
    create and configure (RSS) feeds. In addition to the standard feed
    containing all the new stories, you can now create feeds per topic, for
    upcoming events, and for links.<br>
    This feature is extensible in that plugins can provide additional feeds.
    It is also possible to provide feeds in formats other than RSS 0.91 by
    providing additional feed classes.</li>
<li>Admins can change the block order easily from the list of blocks now.</li>
<li>There is an alternative interface to adding users to groups (requires
    JavaScript).</li>
<li>Users in the Group Admin group can now only assign other users to groups
    of which they themselves are a member.</li>
<li>Image upload can now also use the GD library to scale images.</li>
<li>Comments now use templates.</li>
<li>To accomodate strict webhosts who don't allow file uploads to the standard
    image directory, you can now set a new configuration variable,
    <code>$_CONF['path_images']</code> to point to a directory outside of your
    webtree where article images and user profile pictures will be saved.</li>
<li>Geeklog now supports URL rewriting for story URLs, i.e. you can have URLs
    like <tt>http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/20031229225326631</tt> which
    are known to be picked up by Google.</li>
<li>Plugins can add their own section to Geeklog's What's New block.</li>
<li>All URL fields can now hold up to 255 characters (requires theme updates).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the <a href="theme.html#changes">themes documentation</a> for a
complete list of theme changes.</p>

<p>Also included is the <a href="staticpages.html">Static Pages plugin 1.4</a>,
which now has, among other improvements, a second option to include PHP in
static pages without having to use the PHP <code>return</code> statement.</p>


<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Words from a search query are now properly highlighted in comments. Also
    fixed a problem with highlighting when the search query contained '*'
    characters.</li>
<li>Various fixes in the search class.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that let users register with an empty username.</li>
<li>When batch-importing users, those users were all subscribed to the
    Daily Digest automatically (uses the $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault']
    setting instead now).</li>
<li>Fixed option to delete comments, which previously was only available to
    users in the Root group (e.g. Admin). Now those users that have story.edit
    permissions for the actual story can delete comments.</li>
<li>Deleting a group may have left orphaned entries in the group_assignments
    table (this has been fixed now). When upgrading to 1.3.9, the install
    script will remove any orphaned entries from the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>There have also been a lot of changes to improve security, especially
against SQL injections.</p>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr6">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr6</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the variable
    <code>$topic</code> in the language files (bug #293).</li>
<li>Prevent comment posts on stories or polls were comment posting has been
    disabled.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr5">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr5</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was possible to post anonymous comments, even when anonymous comment
    posting had been switched off in config.php.<br>
    This bug was apparently exploited by spammers to send hundreds of spam
    posts to certain Geeklog sites.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr4">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr4</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was possible for users in the Group Admin and User Admin groups to
    become a member of the Root group (reported by Samuel M. Stone,
    bug #135).</li>
<li>Being admin for a certain area (e.g. Story Admin for stories) made it
    possible to delete all objects in that area (e.g. stories) even if the user
    was not supposed to have access to them, provided the id of the object was
    known.</li>
<li>It was possible to delete other people's personal events if you knew the
    event ID.</li>
<li>It was possible to browse through the comments of a story even if the user
    did not have access to the actual story (reported by Peter Roozemaal).</li>
<li>Due to an XSS issue, it was possible to change someone's account settings
    (including the password) if you got them to click on a specially crafted
    link (reported by Jelmer, fix suggested by Vincent Furia).</li>
<li>The comment display suffered from the possibility of an SQL injection
    (reported by Jelmer).</li>
<li>It was possible to inject Javascript code in the calendar (reported by
    Jelmer).</li>
<li>It was possible to execute (but not save) Javascript code in the comment
    preview (reported by Jelmer).</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr3">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr3</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security-related issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>As "dr.wh0" pointed out, the category field for link submissions was not
    filtered at all. Although you probably can't cause too much harm with
    those 32 characters, this has now been fixed.</li>
<li>Vincent Furia found that the restrictions for the form to email users
    could be circumvented and could even be used to spam users.
    In addition to fixing theses issues, there is now also a speed limit
    on that form (defaults to the speed limit for story submissions).</li>
<li>There was a way to post comments anonymously even when posting for
    anonymous users had been disabled.</li>
<li>It was possible to post comments under someone else's username.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr2">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr2</a></h2>

<p>Jouko Pynnonen found a way to trick the new "forgot password" feature, introduced in 1.3.8, into letting an attacker change the password for <em>any</em> account. This release addresses this issue - there were no other changes.</p>

<p>Obviously, we strongly recommend to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>


<h2><a name="changes138-1sr1">Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr1</a></h2>

<p>The purpose of this release is to address some of the security issues reported in September and early October 2003. We strongly recommend upgrading to this version.</p>

<h3>Security issues</h3>
<ol>
<li>By including Ulf Harnhammar's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kses/" title="kses homepage">kses</a> HTML filter, this release addresses a variety of possible Javascript injection and CSS defacement issues.</li>
<li>Details of SQL errors will not be reported in the browser any more (but only in Geeklog's error.log file). This will avoid disclosing any sensitive information as part of the error message (which is so far the only problem we have found with the alleged SQL injection issues that have been reported).
</ol>

<p>Please note that at the moment we do <strong>not</strong> recommend to use Geeklog with MySQL 4.1 (which, at the time of this writing, is in alpha state and should not be used on production sites anyway). An upcoming release of Geeklog will include more thorough filtering of SQL injections attempts, thus also fixing the problems with MySQL 4.1.</p>

<h3>Other fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the auto-detection of the value for the <code>$_CONF['cookiedomain']</code> variable if the URL included a port number (such as <tt>example.com:8080</tt>). This will fix the login problems some users were reporting.</li>
<li>The full 1.3.8-1sr1 tarball also includes updated French (Canada) and Turkish language files.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes138-1">Geeklog 1.3.8-1</a></h2>

<p>Geeklog 1.3.8-1 is a bugfix release over Geeklog 1.3.8. It contains a
variety of (mostly minor) bugfixes. None of those fixes are security-related.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixes to the new search to restore pre-1.3.8 behavior (display search form
    again if no results are returned, handling of
    <tt>$_CONF['searchloginrequired']</tt>, etc.). Also fixed the search by
    date.</li>
<li>Fixed problems in the install script when trying to identify the MySQL
    version. The install script failed silently on PHP 4.0.4 and earlier
    versions.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the What's Related block on stories that contain
    images.</li>
<li>Skip user "Anonymous" when sending out the Daily Digest.
<li>Prevent admin from changing a user's email address to one that's already
    used by another user.</li>
<li>Update RSS feed and Older Stories block when deleting a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>The full 1.3.8-1 tarball also includes new and updated language files
(see the Changelog for details).</p>


<h2><a name="changes138">Geeklog 1.3.8</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<p>Geeklog 1.3.8 Includes the <strong>Static Pages 1.3 plugin</strong> which
replaces <em>both</em> the Static Pages 1.1 and 1.2 plugins. See the <a
href="staticpages.html">Static Pages documentation</a> for details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The search function has been rewritten. You can now search for the
    exact phrase, all the words, or any of the words from a query. Search
    words are also highlighted in stories.
  <li>New Privacy options: Users can decide whether they want to receive
    email from other users and/or admins and whether they want to show up in
    the Who's Online block.
  <li>You can now get a list of all users who are in a certain group (from the
    Admin's group editor).
  <li>When scaling is configured for images in stories, you can now keep the
    unscaled image (has to be enabled in config.php first). In that case, the
    scaled-down image in the story will serve as a thumbnail and link to the
    unscaled image.
  <li>You can now make one topic the default topic. The topic selection in the
    story submission form will then default to that topic. However, when
    browsing by topic (index.php?topic=Geeklog etc.) new story submissions will
    default to the current topic.
  <li>You can give your users the ability to change their username and delete
    their account. Both features have to be enabled in config.php.
  <li>Extended Plugin API: Plugins can now display content in Geeklog's
    center area, add their own information to the user profile, and add
    information to the site's header (<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section).
  <li>There's a new API for custom registration forms (see
    <tt>lib-custom.php</tt> for sample code).
  <li>There have been quite a few theme changes in order to move most larger
    portions of hard-coded HTML to template files and to give theme designers
    more control over the layout. Please consult the <a
    href="theme.html#changes138">themes documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The "forgot password" function has been rewritten. Instead of resetting
    your old password and sending you a new one, you will now receive an
    email with a unique link in it. If you follow this link, you can enter a
    new password directly. Otherwise, you can simply ignore the email and your
    old password will remain valid.
  <li>Topic access was not always checked properly. If Story Admins report
    getting access denied messages after upgrading to 1.3.8, check your topic
    permissions carefully.
  <li>The poll editor let you enter one answer too many (i.e. when the max.
    number of answers was set to 10 you could actually enter 11). Please check
    your existing polls or you may lose the last answer if you exceeded the
    max. number of answers in a poll (adjust $_CONF['maxanswers'] accordingly,
    if necessary).
  <li>Geeklog should install and run again on old versions of MySQL
    (specifically, 3.22.xx). Please note that some of these old versions aren't
    even supported by MySQL AB any more and MySQL installs older than 3.23.54
    are having security issues.
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes137sr5">Geeklog 1.3.7sr5</a></h2>
<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was possible for users in the Group Admin and User Admin groups to
    become a member of the Root group (reported by Samuel M. Stone,
    bug #135).</li>

<h2><a name="changes137sr3">Geeklog 1.3.7sr3</a></h2>

<p>The purpose of this release is to address some of the security issues reported in September and early October 2003. If you don't plan to upgrade to the latest version of Geeklog (1.3.8-1sr1, at the time of this writing), we strongly suggest you upgrade to at least 1.3.7sr3 instead.</p>

<h2><a name="changes137sr2">Geeklog 1.3.7sr2</a></h2>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>The purpose of this release is to fix the following security issues.
All users are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to upgrade to this version ASAP.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was possible to obtain valid session ids for every account on a Geeklog
    site, including the Admin account (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
<li>Using Internet Explorer, it was possible to upload an image with embedded
    PHP code and execute it (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
<li>Story permissions could override topic permissions, resulting in the display
    of stories to users who shouldn't have access to them (reported by Andrew
    Lawlor). This was already fixed with the new <tt>index.php</tt>, released
    2003-05-15.</li>
<li>Added a warning in <tt>config.php</tt> that adding any of the following
    tags to the list of allowable HTML can make the site vulnerable to
    scripting attacks:<br>
    <code>&lt;img&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;marquee&gt; &lt;script&gt;
          &lt;embed&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;iframe&gt;</code><br>
    (pointed out by Joat Dede).</li>
</ol>

<p>This update also includes fixes for the notorious "permission denied"
error messages that some users would get in the Admin area (e.g. when trying
to save a story and being "only" a user with Story Admin permissions).</p>

<p>The full 1.3.7sr2 tarball also includes various new and updated language
files (see the Changelog for details).</p>


<h2><a name="changes137sr1">Geeklog 1.3.7sr1</a></h2>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>The main purpose of this release is to fix the following security issues.
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to this version.</p>
<ol>
<li>Javascript code could be injected in the homepage field of a user's profile (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
<li>Javascript code could be injected in certain URLs to be used in a cross-site scripting attack (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
<li>Comments could be deleted by anybody if they knew the comment id (which is not normally visible).</li>
<li>A StoryAdmin could manipulate stories even if s/he did not have access to them (e.g. when s/he was not a member of a certain group). The same applied to Admins for events, links, polls, topics, and blocks (reported by Kobaz).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed possible causes for endless loops with the redirect in index.php: No redirect will be done if $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_HOST'] is not set. Also, the comparison of the configured and actual server name is not case-sensitive any more.</li>
<li>Fixed image resizing when using ImageMagick.</li>
<li>The new user notification email (introduced in Geeklog 1.3.7) was always
 sent out, even if 'user' was not listed in $_CONF['notification'].
<li>The Admin menu will now be displayed for users who have Admin access to plugins only, but not to one of the core Admin features.</li>
<li>The default for the daily digest is now back to "off", i.e. new users will not receive it automatically. To enable the daily digest for new users again, set $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault'] = 1 in config.php.</li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation and hard-coded links (version check, link to Geeklog in a site's footer) have been updated to point to <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">www.geeklog.net</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="changes137">Geeklog 1.3.7</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A notification email can now be sent when a new story, link, or event
    has been submitted or a new user has registered with the site (see the
    <a href="config.html#submission">submission settings</a> for details).<br>
    Please note that this feature doesn't tie in with Geeklog's security
    features - it's really more of a hack, since many people asked for this
    functionality.</li>
  <li>Following the "X stories in last 24 hours" link in the What's New block
    will now display just those new stories.</li>
  <li>User photos are now resized, just like images in stories (if the use
    of an image library is configured). The max. dimensions for user photos
    can be set with a separate set of config variables in
    <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
  <li>The plugin menu now lists all plugins which exist in the file system
    but haven't been installed yet. It also provides a link to the install
    script of those plugins for easy installation.</li>
  <li>Several new config variables have been added to config.php (notification,
    showfirstasfeatured, dateonly, timeonly, skip_preview, upcomingeventsrange,
    emailstoryloginrequired, hideemailicon, hideprintericon, hidenewstories,
    hidenewcomments, hidenewlinks, max_photo_width, max_photo_height,
    max_photo_size).  Please see the <a
    href="config.html">config documentation</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Theme changes: Please consult the <a href="theme.html#changes137">themes
    documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added sanity checks in the Admin story editor to prevent the loss of all
    stories when using an incomplete language file (or when manipulating the
    URL).</li>
  <li>Fixed a nasty bug in lib-security.php that let any user with UserAdmin
    permissions change the Root user's password, thus effectively becoming
    root.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with blocks disappearing when they were set to
    "homeonly".</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with multiple [code] ... [/code] sections in stories
    and comments.</li>
  <li>Fixed double line spacing in [code] sections and HTML-formatted comments
    on PHP 4.2.0 and up.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems with slashes and HTML entities in emails sent by
    Geeklog.</li>
  <li>Fixes and improvements to the plugin API.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="addindex">Speeding up Geeklog (a bit)</a></h3>

<p>If you're upgrading from 1.3.6 or older versions, you may want to run the
script called <tt>addindex.php</tt> that you will find in the <tt>install</tt>
directory. This script adds index fields to some of Geeklog's database tables
which should improve overall access times a bit.</p>

<p>This has been implemented as a separate script (and not as part of the
upgrade process of the install script) since it may take some time to run,
depending on how many users / stories / etc. you have in your database. Some
people may even run into timeouts, e.g. when their hosting service limits the
execution time of PHP scripts. If that happens to you - <strong>Don't
Panic</strong>. Simply run the script again (and again and ...) until it
reports that it didn't add any fields to any tables.</p>

<p>Please note that you do <em>not</em> need to run this script if you're doing
a fresh install of Geeklog 1.3.7. A database created during a fresh install
already has the new index fields.</p>


<h2><a name="changes136">Geeklog 1.3.6</a></h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Images in articles can now be resized automatically during upload
    (provided you have either ImageMagick or netpbm installed). See the
    <a href="config.html#image">configuration description</a> for details.</li>
  <li>The contents of a static page entitled "Frontpage" will be displayed
    before the first story on the front page of a Geeklog site. If the static
    page additionally carries the label "nonews", then it will completely
    replace the news on the front page.</li>
  <li>User submission queue: When activated (in <tt><a
    href="config.html#submission">config.php</a></tt>), new users will need to
    be approved by an admin before they receive their password.</li>
  <li>The submission queues can be switched off separately, either completely
    (in <tt><a href="config.html#submission">config.php</a></tt>) or only for
    certain groups of users (by using the new features story.submit,
    links.submit, and event.submit).</li>
  <li>When posting source code (e.g. PHP, HTML, ...), you can now use the
    [code] ... [/code] pseudo tags to enclose those portions of your posting
    that should be reproduced verbatim.</li>
  <li>The links section now uses a categorized and paged display (can be
    <a href="config.html#links">switched off</a> separately and even back to the
    pre-1.3.6 style listing).</li>
  <li>Anonymous users can now be <a href="config.html#login">blocked</a> from
    almost every part of the site (e.g. links section, site stats, ...), if
    needed.</li>
  <li>A Geeklog site can now be disabled easily (e.g. for maintenance) by
    setting a flag in <tt><a href="config.html#site">config.php</a></tt>.</li>
  <li>Theme changes: Please consult the <a href="theme.html#changes136">themes
    documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to ensure that permissions are taken into
    account properly (e.g. not revealing titles of stories that the user has no
    access to).</li>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to make sure that Geeklog can now be
    properly localized (provided you have a language file that is up to date
    and have chosen the proper <a href="config.html#locale">locale settings</a>
    for your country and language).</li>
  <li>The variable $_CONF['site_admin_url'] is now used properly so that you
    can rename Geeklog's <tt>admin</tt> directory if needed.</li>
  <li>New RDF parser will now import most (if not all) RDF news feeds
    properly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since there are a lot of new variables in <tt>config.php</tt>, it is
    recommended you start with a fresh copy of that file instead of copying
    over your old <tt>config.php</tt> from your previous installation.</li>
  <li>Please note that currently only the English, German, Italian, Polish,
    and Japanese language files are up to date. Using one of the other
    language files may result in your Geeklog site not working properly.</li>
</ul>
