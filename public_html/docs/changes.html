<h1>Changes</h1>

<p>This document is intended to give a quick overview over the most import
and / or obvious changes. For a detailed list of changes, please consult the
<a href="history">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

<h2>Geeklog 1.3.6</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>User submission queue: When activated (in <tt>config.php</tt>), new
    users will need to be approved by an admin before they receive their
    password.</li>
  <li>The submission queues can be switched off separately.</li>
  <li>When posting source code (e.g. PHP, HTML, ...), you can now use the
    [code] ... [/code] pseudo tags to enclose those portions of your posting
    that should be reproduced verbatim.</li>
  <li>The links section now uses a categorized and paged display (can be
    switched off separately and even back to the pre-1.3.6 style listing).</li>
  <li>Anonymous users can now be blocked from almost every part of the site
    (e.g. links section, site stats, ...), if needed.</li>
  <li>A Geeklog site can now be disabled easily (e.g. for maintenance) by
    setting a flag in <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
  <li>Theme changes: Please consult the <a href="theme.html#changes">themes 
    documentation</a> for a list of changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to ensure that permissions are taken into
    account properly (e.g. not revealing story titles of stories that the
    user has no access to).</li>
  <li>Several fixes have been made to make sure that Geeklog can now be
    properly localized (provided you have a language file that is up to date
    and have chosen the proper <a href="config.html#locale">locale settings</a>
    for your country and language).</li>
  <li>The variable $_CONF['site_admin_url'] is now used properly so that you
    can rename Geeklog's <tt>admin</tt> directory if needed.</li>
  <li>New RDF parser will now import most (if not all) RDF news feeds
    properly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since there are a lot of new variables in <tt>config.php</tt>, it is
    recommended you start with a fresh copy of that file instead of copying
    over your old <tt>config.php</tt> from your previous installation.</li>
  <li>Please note that currently only the English, German, Italian, Polish,
    and Japanese language files are up to date. Using one of the other
    language files may result in your Geeklog site not working properly.</li>
</ul>
