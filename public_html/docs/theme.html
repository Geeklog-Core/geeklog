<h1>Creating a Theme for Geeklog</h1>

<p>Creating a theme for Geeklog is easy and quite fast. If you can
manipulate HTML files then you can create a theme! There's no need to learn
PHP.

<p>First, let me preface this by saying the theme support, though usable,
isn't complete yet. We plan to make it so that Geeklog admins can upload
themes via a Geeklog web administration page. This will be available in a
later beta release.

<p>Until then people will have to learn how to install themes manually
(covered at the bottom of this document).

<h2>Creating a theme</h2>

<p>First, copy an existing theme that is most similar to what you want to
implement (if one exists). If what you will do is radically different (and
we hope so!) then copying any one will do. Copy the existing theme to the
name you want your theme to have (please, <em>no</em> spaces in the theme name):

<p><kbd>cp -R /path/to/geeklog/public_html/layout/Yahoo /path/to/geeklog/public_html/layout/My_Theme_Name_No_Spaces</kbd>

<p>Change into your new theme directory:

<p><kbd>cd /path/to/geeklog/public_html/layout/My_Theme_Name_No_Spaces</kbd>

<p>Now edit the templates to suit your needs. Keep in mind that templates,
generally are partial HTML files. The directory you just created holds ALL
templates Geeklog needs but you will only need to modify a small few to
make a huge impact on the look.

<p>In particular these are the templates you will undoubtedly want to
change:

<ul>
<li>header.thtml
<li>footer.thtml
<li>blockheader.thtml
<li>blockfooter.thtml
<li>menuitem.thtml
<li>storybody.thtml
<li>storybodytext.thtml
<li>featuredstorybody.thtml
<li>featuredstorybodytext.thtml
<li>style.css
</ul>

<p>When rendering a theme, Geeklog starts with <tt>header.thtml</tt> which builds 
the site's header and then goes on to include the left column of blocks (look 
for the variable {left_blocks} and the <tt>leftblocks.thtml</tt> file). The 
middle part of a site is built of the stories (<tt>storytext.thtml</tt> 
and <tt>storybodytext.thtml</tt>). The <tt>footer.thtml</tt> file then builds 
the right column of blocks (variable {right_blocks}, file 
<tt>right_blocks.thtml</tt>) and the site's footer. Blocks themselves consist 
of the <tt>blockheader.thtml</tt> and <tt>blockfooter.thtml</tt> files.

<p>After you have edited your themes, you are now ready to test it out.
Simply go to http://mygeeklogsite/users.php?mode=peferences in the theme
drop-down select your newly created theme (note the name of your theme is
the <em>same</em> name as the directory for your theme).

<p>Finally, you may want to update the logo and other images in your
theme's images directory.

<p>For the template system we are using PHPLib's template class (<a 
href="http://phplib.sourceforge.net/">http://phplib.sourceforge.net/</a>). 
Read their documentation and, optionally, look at 
/path/to/geeklog/system/classes/template.class.php to see how it is 
implemented. Even with this knowledge it may not be clear which templates 
are used in conjunction with one another (i.e. storybody.thtml and 
storybodytext.thtml together make up the complete format of a 
<em>single</em>
story). If you have questions join our mailing list at our SourceForge site 
at <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geeklog">http://sourceforge.net/projects/geeklog</a> 
or check us out in IRC at irc.freenode.net in #geeklog.</p>

<h3>Theme changes in Geeklog 1.3.6</h3>

<p>There have been a lot of changes in the themes for 1.3.6 to get rid of the
last pieces of hard-coded english texts so as to make localisation easier.
Most of these changes have been made in the Admin editors (<tt>admin</tt> 
directory) and the calendar (<tt>calendar</tt> directory). If you created
your own theme for an earlier version of Geeklog, we recommend that you copy
over these two directories from one of the themes that come with Geeklog
(choose one that is similar to your own theme or which it was originally based
on). It seems like most Geeklog themes didn't change these files anyway, so
this shouldn't be too much of a hassle ...</p>

<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The template file <tt>admin/mail/mailform.thtml</tt> has been added.
    This form for sending emails to other users of the site was previously
    hard-coded into Geeklog.<br>
    If you followed the above advice and copied over the <tt>admin</tt>
    directory to your theme, you got this file already.</li>
  <li>New files have been added and the existing files have been changed for
    the links section (<tt>links</tt> directory). Again, we recommend to just
    copy over those files from one of the themes that ship with Geeklog.<br>
    The new files are: <tt>categoryactivecol.thtml</tt>,
    <tt>categorycol.thtml</tt>, <tt>categorynavigation.thtml</tt>,
    <tt>categoryrow.thtml</tt>, <tt>pagenavigation.thtml</tt></li>
  <li>The user profile has been extended to include a list of the last 10
    stories as well as the total numbers of stories and comments posted by that
    user. Have a look at the file <tt>users/profile.thtml</tt> to see the
    changes or just copy that file over from one of the themes that ship with
    Geeklog.</li>
  <li>The Classic theme has been updated to have an "Edit" link (for
    StoryAdmins) in every story now.</li>
</ul>
