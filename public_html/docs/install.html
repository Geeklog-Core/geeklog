							<p><font color="#FF0000">SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PARSE ERRORS: </font></p>
							<p>Some users have reported that WinZip corrupts certain files in the Geeklog tarball during decompression which will cause errors during the installation process. You are strongly urged not to use WinZip. Try WinRAR if you must decompress the file locally, or better yet, unpack the file from your server (requires telnet/SSH access).</p>
							<p>Parse errors can also be caused by using a WYSIWYG editor on lib-common.php, e.g. Dreamweaver - you should use a "plain text editor".</p>
						</div>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br>
		</ol>

<p>The following instructions will refer to the <tt>public_html</tt> directory
a lot. Here is what this is all about:<p>

<p>Basically, a Geeklog installation consists of two parts: The part that is
visible "to the world" - which is everything in the public_html directory.
"public_html" is a popular name for the world-accessible directory that can be
found on a webserver ("htdocs" is another). So if you have such a directory,
just copy everything from Geeklog's public_html directory into that directory on
your webserver. Then you only need to set up $_CONF['path_html'] (in config.php)
to point to that directory.</p>

<p>The other part of Geeklog, which is everything outside the public_html
directory, should not be accessible via a URL since it contains sensitive
information. So you should really put those files and directories outside of
your document root (i.e. outside the web server's public_html or htdocs
directory). Then you only need to set up $_CONF['path'] (again, in config.php)
to point to the place where you put those files and directories.</p>

<p>Separating the install in this way will also ensure that you can access your
Geeklog site directly via a domain name (if you have one), e.g.
http://www.yourdomain.com/, and that you don't need to include "public_html"
in the URL.</p>

		<p>Please read this section <b>COMPLETELY</b> before beginning.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Unpack the tarball *within* your web tree by running the following in your shell (this assumes you have ssh access and that you are working with the tarball <i>on the designated server </i>- this can be locally or hosted elsewhere):<br>
				<br>
				<code>tar -zxvf geeklog-1.3.6.tar.gz</code><br>
				<br>
				<b>FTP, Windows Users:</b> unpack the tarball on your <i>local computer</i> and upload the result to your designated server. Everything uploads as ASCII except the images.<br>
				<br>
			<li>For *nix installations the following may be required: <br>
				<br>
				<code>chown -R <i>webuser</i>:<i>webuser</i> /path/to/geeklog</code><br>
				<br>This guarantees that everything in that path belongs to you, typical settings are www:www or nobody:nobody and more often than not doesn't matter.<br>
				<br>
			<li>For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and do the following:<br>
				<br>
				<code>chmod -R 775 logs/<br>
					chmod -R 775 public_html/backend/<br>
					chmod -R 775 public_html/images/articles<br>
					chmod -R 775 public_html/images/userphotos</code><br>
				<br>
				<b>FTP Users:</b> If you're doing the chmod via a FTP client, you must also apply the chmod to the files in logs/ and public_html/backend as well as the directories themselves. Most, if not all, ftp clients do not perform this command recursively.  That means you need to set each file within each of these directories manually.<br>

			<br>
			<li>Create the database you want Geeklog to reside in. If you are not familiar with using MySQL, you are urged to get <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.org/" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> and use it to create a new database. If you have no idea what the previous two sentences mean, contact your sysadmin for help.<br>
				<br>
			<li>Edit config.php with the appropriate settings for your server. For installation, this basically means "set your paths," as all other variables can be changed after a successful installation. The config.php file contains comments to help you out. Windows users, you should be able to use the Unix '/' in your paths without any problems. Otherwise, you will need to use the doubled Windows slashes '\\'.<br>

			<li>You can choose to either rename or remove your current Geeklog directory.  Although in the end you will be deleting the older install it's probably safer to keep the old copy around for a few days *just* in-case you forgot to transfer some files.<br>
				<br>
			<li>Uncompress the new version and copy the result to the same path that your old installation had. For instance, if your old Geeklog was in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>, then your new installation should also be in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>.<br>
				<br>
			<li>The next step depends on which version of Geeklog you are upgrading from.<br>
				<br>
				If you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.2 or earlier, change to <code>/path/to/geeklog/sql/updates</code> and apply all needed database updates. For example, if you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.1, you will need to apply 1.1_to_1.2.sql and 1.2_to_1.2.2.sql which will upgrade your database to Geeklog 1.2.5-1. I say 1.2.5-1 because there were no database changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.5-1 (e.g. a 1.2.2 database is the same as a 1.2.5-1 database). If you are uncomfortable using the MySQL command line to do this, you can do it via phpMyAdmin as well.<br>
				<br>
				If you are upgrading from 1.2.5-1 or a more recent version, the second step of the installation script should have an option to convert your database to the current version.<br>
				<br>
        Please note that there were no database changes between versions 1.3.5, 1.3.5sr1, and 1.3.5sr2, so when upgrading from any of those versions, simply select "1.3.5" as your current version.<br>
				<br>
			<li>The rest of the upgrade process is identical to the install process. Once you successfully run the install script, you should be ready to go after restoring any files with custom code.

						<p>Geeklog needs the register_globals variable turned on in order to work. Since PHP 4.2.0, the default for register_globals is "off". To fix it, simply add the following line to your php.ini file:</p>
						<p><code>register_globals=on</code></p>

						<p>You have most likely used WinZip to decompress the Geeklog files. As noted at the top of this document, WinZip sometimes corrupts stuff and these errors are the results. You need to find a different way to decompress the tarball and get the files loaded onto your system</p>
