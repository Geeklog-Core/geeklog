            <li>A telnet or SSH connection to your web server (although FTP will work). This document will be written assuming you have command line access to your server, but we will note the major differences for FTP users.
            <li>The ability to unpack a tarball (file ending in tar.gz)
            <li>You know the difference between a path and a URL

You are strongly urged not to use WinZip. Try WinRAR if you must decompress the file locally, or better yet, unpack the file from your server (requires telnet/SSH access).</p>
                            <p>Parse errors can also be caused by using a WYSIWYG editor on lib-common.php, e.g. Dreamweaver - you should use a "plain text editor".</p>

<p>The following instructions will refer to the
<a name="public_html"><tt>public_html</tt></a> directory a lot. Here is what
this is all about:<p>

<p>Basically, a Geeklog installation consists of two parts: The part that is
visible "to the world" - which is everything in the public_html directory.
"public_html" is a popular name for the world-accessible directory that can be
found on a webserver ("htdocs" and "www" are other popular names). So if you
have such a directory, just copy everything from Geeklog's public_html
directory into that directory on your webserver. Then you only need to set up
$_CONF['path_html'] (in config.php) to point to that directory.</p>

<p>The other part of Geeklog, which is everything outside the public_html
directory, should not be accessible via a URL since it contains sensitive
information. So you should really put those files and directories outside of
your document root (i.e. outside the web server's public_html, htdocs, or www
directory). Then you only need to set up $_CONF['path'] (again, in config.php)
to point to the place where you put those files and directories.</p>

<p>Separating the install in this way will also ensure that you can access your
Geeklog site directly via a domain name (if you have one), e.g.
http://www.yourdomain.com/, and that you don't need to include "public_html"
in the URL.</p>

<p>If your hosting service does not allow you to install files outside of your document root, please see this FAQ entry on geeklog.net: <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/index.php?op=view&amp;t=56">Installing Geeklog entirely within the web root</a>.</p>

        <p>Please read this section <b>COMPLETELY</b> before beginning.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Unpack the tarball *within* your web tree by running the following in your shell (this assumes you have ssh access and that you are working with the tarball <i>on the designated server </i>- this can be locally or hosted elsewhere):<br>
                <br>
                <code>tar -zxvf geeklog-1.4.1.tar.gz</code><br>
                <br>
                <b>FTP, Windows Users:</b> unpack the tarball on your <i>local computer</i> and upload the result to your designated server. Everything uploads as ASCII except the images.<br>
                <br>
            <li>For *nix installations the following may be required: <br>
                <br>
                <code>chown -R <i>webuser</i>:<i>webuser</i> /path/to/geeklog</code><br>
                <br>This guarantees that everything in that path belongs to you, typical settings are www:www or nobody:nobody and more often than not doesn't matter.<br>
                <br>
            <li>For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and do the following:<br>
                <br>
                <code>chmod -R 775 logs<br>
                    chmod -R 775 data<br>
                    chmod -R 775 backups<br>
                    chmod -R 775 public_html/backend<br>
                    chmod -R 775 public_html/images/articles<br>
                    chmod -R 775 public_html/images/topics<br>
                    chmod -R 775 public_html/images/userphotos</code><br>
                <br>
                <b>FTP Users:</b> If you're doing the chmod via a FTP client, you must also apply the chmod to the files <b>in</b> logs/ and public_html/backend as well as the directories themselves. Most, if not all, ftp clients do not perform this command recursively.  That means you need to set each file within each of these directories manually.<br>

If you have no idea what the previous two sentences mean, contact your sysadmin for help.<br>
                <br>
            <li>Edit config.php with the appropriate settings for your server. For installation, this basically means "set your paths," as all other variables can be changed after a successful installation. The config.php file contains comments to help you out.<br><br>
Windows users, you should be able to use the Unix '/' in your paths without any problems. Otherwise, you will need to use the doubled Windows slashes '\\'.<br><br>
<em>Please read the comments in config.php carefully.</em><br>
                <br>

            <li>You can choose to either rename or remove your current Geeklog directory.  Although in the end you will be deleting the older install it's probably safer to keep the old copy around for a few days *just* in-case you forgot to transfer some files.<br>
                <br>
            <li>Uncompress the new version and copy the result to the same path that your old installation had. For instance, if your old Geeklog was in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>, then your new installation should also be in <code>/usr/home/www/geeklog/</code>.<br>
                <br>
                        <li>As with a fresh install, edit your <strong>config.php</strong> and <strong>lib-common.php</strong>, basically just copying over the information from your old copies of these files.<br>
                <br>
            <li><em>If</em> you are upgrading <strong>from Geeklog 1.2 or earlier</strong>, change to <code>/path/to/geeklog/sql/updates</code> and apply all needed database updates. For example, if you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.1, you will need to apply 1.1_to_1.2.sql and 1.2_to_1.2.2.sql which will upgrade your database to Geeklog 1.2.5-1. I say 1.2.5-1 because there were no database changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.5-1 (e.g. a 1.2.2 database is the same as a 1.2.5-1 database). If you are uncomfortable using the MySQL command line to do this, you can do it via phpMyAdmin as well.<br><br>
            If you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.3 or later, you can skip this step.<br>
                <br>
            <li>Open your browser and navigate to <strong>http://yourgeeklogsite/admin/install/install.php</strong>. Enter your path to Geeklog and make sure you select <strong>Upgrade Database</strong> as the installation type, before you click on the "Next" button. The second step of the installation script should have an option to convert your database to the current version.<br>
                <br>
Please note that only "basic" version numbers are listed, because, for example, Geeklog 1.3.7 and 1.3.7sr2 use the same database. So if you're upgrading from Geeklog 1.3.7sr2, just select "1.3.7" (the same applies to 1.3.5 / 1.3.5sr1 / 1.3.5sr2 and all the various 1.3.8 versions).<br>
                <br>
            <li>Once you see the success message, your upgrade is complete. <b>You can now delete the admin/install directory</b> (and all files within it).<br><br>

<p>A parse error usually hints at a typo you've made. Check the file at the

<ul>
<li>not enclosing paths in single quotes properly</li>
<li>missing semicolon at the end of the line</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The path that you've entered for the <b>$_CONF['path']</b> variable in config.php is not correct. Make sure you typed it correctly. Also make sure it uses
an <em>absolute</em> path, i.e. one that starts at the root of your file
system (and that it starts with a / under Unix/Linux or a drive letter under
Windows).</p>

<p>You must have run the install script before (possibly unsuccessfully). To
be on the save side, drop the database and create a  new, empty database
before trying to run the install script again.</p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

<p>All of the above cases (and similar "parse error" messages you may get for lib-common.php, typically with a line number in the 3000 or 4000 range) indicate a <b>corrupted lib-common.php</b> file.</p>
<p>As noted <a href="#ParseError">at the top of this document</a> this is usually caused by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncompressing the tarball with certain versions of <b>WinZip</b> (try using WinRar instead)</li>
<li>Editing the lib-common.php with <b>Dreamweaver</b> or other so-called WYSIWYG HTML editors (use a simple text editor instead)</li>
<li>Editing the lib-common.php with "on-site" text editors built into tools like <b>Cpanel</b> (again, use a simple text editor instead)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to unpack a fresh copy of the lib-common.php and edit it again, using a "normal" text editor. Windows users can find some recommendations for editors to use in <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=3&amp;showtopic=11866" title="Forum thread: Text editors?">this</a> and <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=3&amp;showtopic=15807" title="Forum thread: How to edit lib-common without Notepad on Windows?">this</a> thread in the forums on geeklog.net.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>This is a path problem again. Check the setting for <b>$_CONF['path_html']</b>. If you did not change or rename Geeklog's <tt>public_html</tt> directory, then there's no need to change that setting at all (restore the line to its
original content). Otherwise, please read the comments above that line in
config.php again carefully to understand how to change that line properly.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>First of all, make sure the database settings in <tt>config.php</tt> are correct, specifically the name and password of your MySQL user, the name of your database, and the name of your MySQL server.</p>
<p>If you're running your own server, you may need to give your MySQL user
proper permissions. Log in to MySQL as the MySQL root user and issue these
commands:</p>
<code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <em>database_name</em> TO <em>user@host</em> IDENTIFIED BY '<em>password</em>';<br>
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</code>
<p>Replacing the lower-case strings with the actual values, of course.</p>
<p>If you want (or need) to be more restrictive with database permissions:
You will need to at least grant the ALTER, CREATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and
UPDATE permissions to your database user. ALTER and CREATE permissions are only
needed for installing and upgrading Geeklog, as well as for installing plugins
and other add-ons.</p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                        <p>Make sure that the logs/ directory AND the files in it have permissions of at least 775. You may need to make the permissions 777 if 775 isn't working for you. For good measure, make sure the public_html/backend directory and the geeklog.rss file have the same 775 or 777 permissions.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the script that is located at <b>http://yourgeeklogsite/admin/install/check.php</b> to test if all the permissions have been set up correctly.</p>

                        <p>Make sure that your config.php file does not contain any "whitespace" after the closing <b>?&gt;</b> at the end of the file. I.e. there should not be anything (not even blanks or empty lines) after those two characters.</p>

The Support section includes a <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/">FAQ</a> and a <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/search.php">search system</a> (try searching for the error message, if you get one).</p>
                            <p>2) Visit the mailing list archives at <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/pipermail/geeklog-users/">http://lists.geeklog.net/pipermail/geeklog-users/</a>. You can also <a href="http://lists.geeklog.net/listinfo/geeklog-users">subscribe to the mailing list</a> and post your question to the Geeklog community.</p>
                            <p>3) Try the chat room at <b>irc.freenode.net, channel #geeklog</b>. Please have all your path information in config.php and lib-common.php readily available.</p>
                            <p>4) Try entering the text of the error message on Google. Chances are you will find someone else who had the same problem and fixed it.  And sometimes searching for a specific error will cause Google to bring up broken pages that have the same error.</p>
