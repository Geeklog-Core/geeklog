<h2>June 15, 2008 (1.5.0)</h2>

<p>Geeklog 1.5.0 incorporates the following projects implemented during the 2007 Google Summer of Code:</p>

	<li>New user-friendly install script by Matt West</li>
	<li>New Configuration GUI (replacing config.php) by Aaron Blankstein</li>
	<li>New Webservices API based on the Atom Publishing Protocol by Ramnath R. Iyer</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes since 1.5.0rc2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Users that used a different theme than the site default would see the site switch temporarily back to the site's default theme when changing a config option. This was a side effect of the fix for bug #0000648 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In a tradeoff between security and convenience, we decided to go with security: The install script will no longer display the database credentials from db-config.php. The downside is that you will have to enter them again when doing a database upgrade or re-running the install (reported by Mark Evans) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Links plugin: The word "Root" wasn't taken from the language file for the page title of the public list of links (reported by Markus Wollschl&auml;er) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed remaining places where the Admin panels had inconsistent layouts:<br>Calendar list of events, Polls editor (bug #0000650) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Updated Hebrew language file, provided by LWC</li>
	<li>Updated German language files, provided by Markus Wollschl&auml;er</li>

	<li>Fixed setting the site's default language and default theme (bugs #0000646 and #0000648) [Aaron, Dirk]</li>
	<li>The bundled plugins don't need to read their config.php any more. This also avoids confusion if renaming the old config.php failed during the upgrade [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Fixed problems with the text direction in the install script (reported by LWC) [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Updated Hebrew language files, provided by LWC</li>
	<li>Updated Japanese language files, provided by Takahiro Kambe, Tetsuko Komma, and the Geeklog.jp group<br>Note: Only the UTF-8 versions of the Japanese language files are supported from now on. The euc-jp versions have been removed from the distribution.</li>

	<li>The {lang_attribute} can only properly be set in a multi-language setup (bug #0000616) [Dirk]</li>

  site does not send an X-Pingback header [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When sending Pingbacks for a story that had identical link texts for different URLs, only the last of those links was pinged [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Implemented new Autouninstall for plugins. Plugins runs a function that passes a specific array to a core function that removes all given element of the plugin.  The function inside the plugin can handle aditional removals that the core code cannot [Oliver]</li>

	<li>Only allow autotags in normal blocks (bug #653) [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Allow comments to be closed, i.e. display the existing comments but don't accept any new ones [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Added timezone selector to preferences page [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Fixed COM_getLangSQL() to escape the underscore character '_' which happens to be a wildcard character when used with LIKE. In a multi-language setup, this may accidentally display unwanted items (reported by Kenji Ito) [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Mark Evans provided a set of patches that let plugins hook into the user registration, story and comment submission as well as the contact user and email story forms. These hooks can be used to add CAPTCHAs to those forms, but may also come in handy for other plugin applications. Also modified several template files to include a {captcha} variable to ease installation of Mark's CAPTCHA plugin.</li>

	<li>In the admin's story editor, set the debug option for the image upload only when $_CONF['debug_image_upload']  = true (thus avoiding the "Warning: File #x on the HTML form was empty" messages in error.log) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Renamed [calendar:] autotag back to [event:] for backward compatibility. It also makes more sense this way, since it does provide a link to an event, not a link to a calendar (bug #619) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Need to check if field 'etids' is NULL (for MySQL 4) for the Daily Digest (bug #595) [Dirk]</li>

	<li>COM_isFrontpage has been deprecated, as it had its return values inverted (returns false when on the site's index page). Use COM_onFrontpage instead from now on [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed check for new stories from archive topic [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Call PLG_templateSetVars() from STORY_renderArticle() so we can have custom variables in the story templates [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Updated Chinese language files (traditional and simplified), provided by Samuel M. Stone</li>
	<li>Updated Japanese language files for Geeklog and all the plugins, provided by the Geeklog Japanese group</li>

	<li>Moved the defines for STORY_ARCHIVE_ON_EXPIRE and STORY_DELETE_ON_EXPIRE to lib-story.php (from config.php) where they make more sense [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Tried to make "3 new stories in the last 1 day" sound less awkward by going back one unit, i.e. "3 new stories in the last 24 hours", in the What's New block (likewise for 1 week, 1 month, etc.) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced config options to set the default for the story's draft flag and frontpage option (feature request #163) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced $_CONF['hide_main_page_navigation'] to hide the "Google paging" from index.php (may be useful for some layouts) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow (optional) usage of autotags in "normal" blocks (can be enabled / disabled per block) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a {story_counter} variable in the story templates. It's 0 on the article page and in previews, but 1 for the first story, 2 for the second, etc. on the index page (per page, i.e. starts with 1 again on the second page) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Require that users enter their current password when changing their password, email address or "Remember me for" setting. Redesigned the Account Information page and added a note about this requirement. [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Prevent accidental banning of users when the Admin edits a user's information using a theme that wasn't updated for Geeklog 1.4.0+ [Dirk]</li>

	<li>In the Admin's user list, banned users are indicated by striked-through entries (based on a hack by Andy Maloney) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added new setting $_CONF['onlyrootfeatures']. This is for sites where two or more story admins can feature stories that the other admins cannot see.

	<li>Changed "Reply"-button to "Post a comment" [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Implemented an error handler to supress all PHP level errors and display a much more userfriendly error text to the end user. Prevents all path exposure, prevents "white error page" mystery debugging fun. [Mike]</li>

	<li>Added email confirmation fields for new user and usersettings [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Allow changing of group ownership for "gldefault" blocks. Requires a change in admin/block/defaultblockeditor.thtml to enable the group dropdown. On a fresh install, all the blocks (with the exception of "Are you secure?") are now owned by the Block Admin group [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Users created by a User Admin should not be queued for approval, even when $_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced 'syndication.edit' permission and 'Syndication Admin' group so that access to the Content Syndication panel no longer requires 'Root' permissions [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Renamed the misnamed CUSTOM_runSheduledTask function (in lib-custom.php) to CUSTOM_runScheduledTask. Don't forget to make that change in your copy of lib-custom.php if you're using that functionality! [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Extended plugin API for feed extensions to include feed id and the topic (for adding topic/feed specific data) [Mike]</li>

	<li>Made changes to ensure compatibility with MS SQL, as suggested by Randy Kolenko [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Added support for a custom login error handler function, CUSTOM_loginErrorHandler [Blaine]</li>

	<li>Made the search option on the Admin pages behave like the site search, i.e. it doesn't require you to pad queries with '*' any longer [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In story search results, show/hide the "Author" and "Views" columns based on the $_CONF['contributedbyline'] and $_CONF['hideviewscount'] settings [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced $_CONF['title_trim_length'] to make the max. title length of items in the What's New block configurable (feature request #525). Also implemented a new function COM_truncate (based on a patch by Yusuke Sakata) that properly handles truncation of multi-byte text strings if the mb_ functions are available [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a JavaScript confirmation box to most delete buttons/links. If you'd rather not have such a confirmation, use {delete_option_no_confirmation} instead of {delete_option} in the admin templates [Dirk]</li>

<h2>July 23, 2006 (1.4.0sr5-1)</h2>

<p>This release fixes display problems in the comment preview that were only in Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 (as a result of the fix for the XSS).</p>

<p>The complete 1.4.0sr5-1 tarball also includes the following language files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New Afrikaans language file, provided by Renier Maritz</li>
	<li>Updated Hebrew language file, provided by LWC</li>
	<li>Updated Turkish language file, provided by Kemal Cellat</li>
</ul>

<h2>July 16, 2006 (1.4.0sr5)</h2>

<p>JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible XSS in the comment handling that we're with this release.</p>


<h2>June 30, 2006 (1.4.0sr4)</h2>

<p>Two exploits have been released by "rgod" for insecure Geeklog installations for a bug in the "mcpuk" file manager that we've been shipping as part of in all 1.4.0 releases.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some of the files outside of the public_html directory were not protected against direct execution. If Geeklog was installed such that those files were accessible from a URL (which has always been strongly discouraged in the installation instructions) then those files could be used to load and execute malicious code from a remote server.<br>
  <p>More information: http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/so-called-exploit</p>

  <p>In this release, we've added the missing execution prevention for all files outside of public_html. We would still, however, suggest that you fix your Geeklog install if the files outside of public_html are accessible from a URL.</p></li>

	<li>The "mcpuk" file manager that we've integrated into FCKeditor allowed the upload of arbitrary PHP code (even if FCKeditor was disabled in Geeklog's config.php). Depending on your webserver's configuration, it was then possible to execute that uploaded code.<br>

  <p>More information:<br>
  <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/exploit-for-fckeditor-filemanager">http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/exploit-for-fckeditor-filemanager</a><br>
  The file manager has been removed from this release. You will therefore no longer be able to upload files, e.g. images, through FCKeditor. Future versions of Geeklog will ship with an updated version of FCKeditor and its included file manager.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>May 28, 2006 (1.4.0sr3)</h2>

<p>The Security Science Researchers Institute Of Iran reported the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Possible SQL injection and authentication bypass in auth.inc.php</li>
	<li>Possible XSS in getimage.php</li>
	<li>Path disclosure in getimage.php and the functions.php of some themes, e.g. the Professional theme</li>
</ul>

<p>An internal code review also revealed a possible SQL injection in story.</p>


<h2>Mar 5, 2006 (1.4.0sr2)</h2>

<p>Security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would allow anyone to log in as any user.</li>
	<li>HTML was not stripped from the Location field in a user's profile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feb 19, 2006 (1.4.0sr1)</h2>

	<li>In Command and Control, show the Trackback icon only when at least one of the Trackback, Pingback, or Ping features is enabled (in addition to 'story.ping' permissions for the current user) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Replaced the delete_event.gif icon (in layout/professional/images/icons) with a PNG, since the Professional theme uses PNGs now and the icon wouldn't show up otherwise [Dirk]</li>

	<li>Don't emit the Trackback and Pingback headers when trackbacks have been disabled for a story [Dirk]</li>

</ul>

<h2>Nov 20, 2005 (1.4.0b1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Introduced {start_storylink_anchortag} and {end_storylink_anchortag} template variables in the story and commentbar template files which only produce a link to the story when not on article.php, thus avoiding links back to the article page itself, which the spider for Google News doesn't seem to like (feature request #486) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a workaround for image uploads using GD when ImageCreateTrueColor is not available (patch #468) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow a subject to be passed as a parameter for the "contact user" form (based on patch #497) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added support for right-to-left languages (based on patch #488) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Update Feeds and Older Stories block when changing topic settings [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a hits counter to events and added a Top Ten Events section to the site stats [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced $_CONF['show_topic_icon'], i.e. the default setting whether to show topic icons or not [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The "Older Stories" block now only lists articles that appeared on the frontpage (i.e. have not been set to "Show only in topic", bug #408) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with query highlighting in stories scrambling links in autotags (bug #492) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Group names are now unique (as they should have been from the beginning). The install script takes care of existing duplicate group names when upgrading to 1.4.0 (bug #367) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow for more topic IDs in the user's preferences (bug #490) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Replace autotags in the Daily Digest (bug #484) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Explicitly link to /docs/index.html for the documentation link in the Admin's block (bug #504) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added an option to enable / disable trackbacks per story (just like you can enable / disable comments per story) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Changed COM_optionList to check for language arrays which override the text strings that are embedded in the database (for comment mode, featured story, post mode, etc.) Bug #227 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed Bug #174 -- quotes in titles are no longer double htmlentized [Vinny]</li>
	<li>The default permissions for new objects (stories, topics, blocks, etc.) can now be set in config.php (feature request #90) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added an "Active users" entry to the site statistics. If Geeklog is configured to track a user's last login, this will display the number of users who logged into the site during the last 4 weeks. Otherwise, it displays the number of user accounts with status = 3 (i.e. have logged into their account at least once and haven't been banned) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a new plugin API function so that the plugin's summary (e.g. number of items) can be properly integrated with the "Site Stats" section. Modified stats/sitestatistics.thtml, removed stats/stats.thtml, added stats/singlesummary.thtml template files [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a generic function, USER_getPhoto, which provides the user's photo, if available. The function also supports getting the user's avatar from gravatar.com (if enabled in config.php) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The texts in the What's New block ("x new stories in the last y hours", "last 2 weeks", etc.) now properly reflect the actual settings of the $_CONF['newXXXinterval'] variables (bug #390) [Oliver, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a method to signal a forced update for feeds in case the content of one of the feed entries has changed  - so far, we only checked if entries had been added or removed (bug #277) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added $_CONF['show_right_blocks'] option which, if set = true, will display right-side blocks on all pages (also addresses feature request #31) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed bug #454, SQL error when reading comments. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Leave off the "page=1" parameter on the "Google paging" navigation bar for links that point back to the first page [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The default feed for a new site is now in RSS 2.0 format and named "geeklog.rss" [Mike, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added time of the day to the name of the database backups to allow several backups a day [Oliver]</li>
	<li>When the search returns no results, the search form is now pre-populated with the last search query, so that it can be changed easily. On successful searches, a "refine search" link will appear that also takes you back to a pre-populated search form (to refine your search, obviously) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Changed search to only return a certain amount of hits per page, thus avoiding timeouts on servers where the script execution time is limited (bug #274) [Dirk]</li>
  <li>A new config variable, $_CONF['num_search_results'], defines the number of search results to be returned per page (and per type). The search form also includes a drop-down menu where this can be changed for every search.  Plugins will have to indicate if they support this "paged" search. Otherwise, Geeklog will fake the paging for the plugin, so that the plugin does a full search for every page, but Geeklog will only display the hits for the current page (such a plugin can therefore still cause a timeout until it is changed to support "paged" searching).</li>
	<li>Added a permanent link to comments (in the professional theme) [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Added new icons for the admin sections and made sure each admin section now has an icon in admin/moderation.php [Dirk]</li>
  <li>The new icons have been taken from the Gnome project (some of them modified by Jakub Steiner). They are released under the GPL.</li>
	<li>Introduced global variable $_IMAGE_TYPE that specifies the image type to use. Defaults to 'gif'. Themes can override it to use other images types, e.g. PNG, for all images [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added option to upload topic icons (Feature Request #415, Patch #423), provided by Alford Deeley (machinari)</li>
	<li>Changed the Admin's "Command and Control" center such that there is an icon for every entry in the Admin's block [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed duplicate code for creating a "topic SQL" query in moderation.php (use COM_getTopicSQL instead) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added the ability to allow users to login via defined remote services (ships with Blogger and LiveJournal support) [Mike]</li>
	<li>Added the ability to ban users, and to tell when a user has logged in at least once [Mike]</li>
	<li>Added edit-icon, List-Sorting, searching, Limits &amp; alternating row colors in admin menus for groups, syndication, staticpages, trackback (where not yet done) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added function to allow user-defined scaling of images in articles by using [unscaledX] instead of [imageX] [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Removed $_CONF['whosonline_fullname'] option - use $_CONF['show_fullname'] instead [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where extra slashes appeared when previewing comments [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Removed the "lastvisit" cookies, as they are obviously not used [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed redundant changepwd-button &amp; code from /admin/user.php (Bug #9) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added new feature to insert a feed-links into header depending on topic, to be chosen from /admin/syndication.php in the form of &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/{format}+xml" ....&gt; [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added options to google-Navigation so it can be used by plugins and work with url-rewriting (feature request #315). [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Userlist now also shows Registration Date and if $_CONF['lastlogin']= true it shows the last login date instead. [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added option in config.php to hide "Viewed: x" line with $_CONF['viewscountline'] just as the $_CONF['contributedbyline'] [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added function COM_numberFormat to format displayed numbers with custom decimal &amp; thousand - separators and fixed decimal places if necessary Includes the respecitve 3 new config.php values in locale section. (Feature Request #298) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Default Blocks showed always in all Topics before. Now you can choose to show them in All/only one topic/only on homepage like other blocks (feature #326) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>A Story can now break over several pages in the body-text. The tag [page_break] will split the bodytext in pieces that can be opened with the
  std. COM_printPageNavigation. Introtext is removed for pages&gt;1 [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added field for old password check in /usersettings.php (bug #230) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Added password confirmation to /admin/user.php and /usersettings.php (bug #230) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Made the alternating row colors in the Admin's trackback functions compatible with the scheme used in other places (list of users, etc.). Also changed the list of weblog directory services so that editing is now done by clicking on the number of the service [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Stories are no longer forced to be featured _and_ on frontpage (bug #362) [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Changed links locations in User-list, added user-photo indicator [Oliver]</li>
	<li>Don't update a story's date any more when unchecking the 'draft' flag (bug #400) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Don't use "rewritten" URLs in the static pages editor any more (bug #403). Also updated the list of static pages to use alternating colors for the rows [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Use "\r\n" when sending trackback pings (bug #407) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow autotags to optionally have a space after the tag name [Blaine]<br>
  Valid tags are:<br>
  [story:20040101093000103 here] or [story: 20040101093000103 here]</li>
	<li>Fixed inconsistent use of {site_url} and {layout_url} in some of the professional theme's admin template files - using {layout_url} everywhere now when referring to icons (bug #395) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Event titles containing quotes were cut off at the first quote in the event editor, i.e. both the admin's event editor and the editor for personal events. (bug #399) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Modified PLG_templateSetVars API to also check for a custom function [Blaine]<br>
  Users can now set header template using CUSTOM_templatesetvars()</li>
	<li>Added new CSS declarations as recommened CSS for plugins   [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Added a basic scheduler Plugin API plugin_runScheduledTask  [Blaine]<br>
  Interval is set in config.php - $_CONF['cron_schedule_interval']</li>
	<li>Enhanced the Group Admin interface display [Blaine]</li>

	<li>Complete overhaul of the Plugin Comment API to reduce the likelyhood of plugins introducing security problems.  Older plugins that use the comment API will no longer work. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Refactored Comment code out of lib-common.php and into lib-comment.php, also some changes to comment.php [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Introduced a 'story.ping' permission that enables users to send Pings, Pingbacks, and Trackbacks for a story (or plugin item). Members of the Story Admin group have that permission by default.</li>
	<li>Overhauled install script: It will now abort the installation if the minumum requirements (PHP 4.1.0, MySQL 3.23.2) are not met. It also displays a warning message if register_long_arrays is off (PHP 5 only, bug #360). Another warning message is displayed if "public_html" is part of the URL. When upgrading, it now tries to identify the Geeklog version that was used previously (only really works for versions 1.3.8 - 1.3.11) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed date in comment preview (bug #370) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Incorporated the new syndication framework for reading and writing feeds of different formats (RSS, RDF, Atom), provided by Michael Jervis (patch #352). This contribution also addresses Task #19 ("RSS import class") and Feature Request #67 ("Limiting number of entries in RSS feeds"). Please note that the feed writer classes, system/classes/*.feed.class.php, are now obsolete and can be removed. Please also note this adds new PEAR package requirements for Net_URL and HTTP_Request.</li>
	<li>Added support for sending and receiving trackback comments (Feature Request #34) Also implemented Pingback support in pretty much the same way. Once received, Geeklog treats Trackbacks and Pingbacks the same and stores them in the gl_trackback table. [Dirk]<br>
  Both can be switched off in config.php: $_CONF['trackback_enabled'] = false; and $_CONF['pingback_enabled'] = false;</li>
	<li>Added a new script, directory.php, that implements a date-based listing of all the stories on a site [Dirk]</li>
  <li>A link to the directory is available as a new option, 'directory', for the $_CONF['menu_elements'] config variable, so that it can be added to the menu. The column headline for event search results was not displayed [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added logos to syndication feeds. [Mike]</li>
	<li>Added config option to disable new accounts (Patch #426 from Alford Deeley) [Mike]</li>

	<li>Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata</li>
	<li>New Farsi (Persian) language file for the static pages plugin, provided by Hesam.H</li>
</ul>

<h2>Oct 9, 2005 (1.3.11sr2)</h2>

<p>This release provides security enhancements and better spam protection originally developed for Geeklog 1.3.12. It also addresses a few bugs where the bugfix could be integrated with a reasonable amount of work (other bugfixes will have to wait for the 1.3.12 release).</p>

<h3>Security and Spam protection:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added speedlimit to login attempts, defaults to allowing three tries in a five minute period.  [Vinny]<br>
  See new config options $_CONF['login_attempts'] and $_CONF['login_speedlimit']</li>
	<li>Changed the spam handling to update the speed limit when spam is detected (i.e. handle spam posts as if they were successful posts and make the submitter wait for the speed limit to expire). Also send a 403 "Forbidden" HTTP response code when displaying the "spam detected" message [Dirk]<br>
  To quote RFC2616: "403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated."</li>
	<li>Filter linefeeds in the To:, From:, and Subject: fields of an email in COM_mail [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When a new user account is created and the user submission queue is enabled in config.php, ensure that the user is properly "queued" even in the unlikely event that the account creation fails halfway through (reported by LWC) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When $_CONF['emailstoryloginrequired'] = 1, hide the links to the "email story" form from anonymous users [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When emailing a story, check the user's message that is sent with the story for spam [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a robots.txt file to the distribution. By default, it excludes comment.php, submit.php, and the docs directory from being spidered [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a spam check to the user profile [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Story, event, and link submissions are now also checked for spam [Dirk]</li>
	<li>This release also includes the Spam-X plugin version 1.0.2</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that MT-Blacklist (used by Spam-X) has recently been discontinued. For the time being, we provide the last version of the blacklist for download from geeklog.net (the Spam-X plugin as included in this release is configured to get it from there for the initial import). There will, however, be no updates the blacklist. For details, please see <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued">http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/mt-blacklist-discontinued</a></p>

<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error message thrown up by PHP 5.0.5 or later when viewing the article page (bug #483) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed bug with topic-specific blocks not showing up on the article page when URL rewriting was enabled (bug #401) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed missing site header when trying to submit an event without required fields. Also fixed that it would redirect you to the story submission form then (bug #409) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Make sure {menu_elements} is rendered using the menuitem_none.thtml template when no menu elements are to be displayed (bug #378) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Quote names in email addresses as soon as they contain any non-alphanumeric characters (apart from the blank). This also addresses bug #368 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow single quotes in passwords (bug #396, also previously reported as bug #349 / #996354) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When $_CONF['profileloginrequired'] was set to 1, the actual message that you have to log in before being able to see a user profile was not wrapped in the Geeklog framework (reported by Sean C) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fix: Made a story's archive/expire date work with the timezone hack [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_applyFilter will now accept negative numbers if the isnumeric parameter is true. Needed to fix problems with pollbooth.php (and others) [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Upgraded included kses class to version 0.2.2 which fixes problems with Japanese and Thai characters (among other things), thus addressing bugs #94 and #119 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed SQL error when using the [staticpage:] autotag (bug #373) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a missing stripslashes call to remove backslashes when a topic's name was displayed in the index page's title (bug #369) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Link tags are now translated in printer friendly mode (Bug #411) [Mike]</li>
	<li>Removed the &lt;meta name="ROBOTS"&gt; entry from the Professional theme's header.thtml as "INDEX,FOLLOW" is the default anyway. For finer control, we now ship a robots.txt [Dirk]</li>
</ul>

<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't check for auto-archived stories when no archive topic has been defined yet [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added support for a custom_usercheck function. Custom registration code that requires certain information can now abort the creation of a new account if that information is missing. The function is called after Geeklog has checked that the username and email address of the new user are okay (valid and not in the database yet), but before the user has been added to the database [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Saved one SQL request for a story's printable view [Dirk]</li>
</ul>

<p>Language files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Made sure all language files refer to Geeklog's [image] tags as [imageX], [imageX_right], and [imageX_left] (bug #381) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>New Catalan language file, provided by an anonymous user</li>
	<li>New Russian (UTF-8) language file, provided by Konstantin Boyandin</li>

</ul>

<h2>Aug 21, 2005 (Spam-X plugin 1.0.2)</h2>

	<li>Changed the display name of the plugin to "Spam-X" to avoid potential confusion with the email spam filter of the same name. "SpamX" is a registered trademark of Hendrickson Software Components.</li>
	<li>Added a new module to filter posts based on the IP address of the poster [Tom Willet]</li>
	<li>Added  a new module to filter posts based on the IP address of the spamvertised site [Tom Willet]</li>
	<li>Added a new module to filter posts based on characteristics of the HTTP header [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed the Mass Delete Spam Comments module [Tom Willet]</li>
	<li>The Spam-X plugin's examine modules run the post through html_entity_decode() now in case the spammers try to obfuscate their posts by using HTML entities [Tom Willet, Dirk]</li>
	<li>The Mail Admin action module now also reports the HTTP headers of the post that triggered the spam filter [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a simple stats function (reports the number of posts deleted as spam, and - to the Spam-X Admin only - the number of entries for each module) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Implemented an update function for the plugin [Dirk]</li>
	<li>New Farsi (Persian) language file, provided by Hesam.H</li>
	<li>New Italian language file, provided by Marcello Teodori</li>
	<li>New Spanish language file, provided by vivi1123</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jul 3, 2005 (1.3.11sr1)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issue:</p>

<p>Stefan Esser found an SQL injection that can, under certain circumstances, be exploited to extract user data such as the user's password hash.</p>


<h2>Dec 31, 2004 (1.3.11)</h2>

<p>Geeklog 1.3.11 addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions were turned off in config.php (reported by Barry Wong).  These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you disabled it in config.php.</li>
	<li>Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered, leaving them open to potential SQL injections.</li>
	<li>The links for the What's Related block were created from the unfiltered story text, opening the possibility of XSS attacks (reported by Vincent Furia).</li>
</ol>

<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added a missing stripslashes() call for the topic name in the What's Related block (bug #351) [Dirk]<br>(affected file: system/lib-story.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed problems in the story editor when editing plain-text posts with uploaded images (bug #356) [Dirk]<br>
  (affected file: public_html/admin/story.php)</li>
	<li>When changing a story ID, update the story ID in any comments to that story, too (bug #357) [Dirk]<br>
  (affected file: public_html/admin/story.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of autotags that started with the same substring, e.g. for 2 tags 'mytag' and 'mytagtwo', the second tag would not be recognized (reported by Dr. Shakagee) [Dirk]<br>
  (affected file: system/lib-plugins.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed caching of $_GROUPS [Dirk]<br>
  (affected files: system/lib-security.php, public_html/lib-common.php)</li>
	<li>Made a minor optimization to save one SQL request when displaying the comment bar for anonymous users [Dirk]<br>
  (affected file: public_html/lib-common.php)</li>
	<li>Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.<br>
  (affected file: language/slovenian.php)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dec 22, 2004 (1.3.11rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed "archive" option being activated too early on certain non-featured stories (bug #345) [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Added missing handling of autotags in static pages being displayed as center blocks (reported by Jill) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed size of the 'sid' field in the gl_comments table. It should be 40 characters, to be able to hold the long story IDs introduced in 1.3.10 (reported by Douglas Santos) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When using mogrify (ImageMagick) to resize uploaded images, the name of the image is now enclosed in double quotes instead of single quotes, which caused the command to fail on Windows [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The emails sent from the Spam-X plugin's MailAdmin action now also include the IP address of the spam poster [Dirk]</li>
	<li>SEC_getFeatureGroup() should not overwrite $_GROUPS if not operating on the current user (bug #331) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a {camera_icon} variable in story and comment templates that displays the little camera icon if the author has uploaded a user photo, just like in the Who's Online block (suggested by Laurence Whitworth) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The parent link in top-level comments took the user to the homepage rather than to the article page (bug #346) [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Stories submitted for the archive topic will automatically be saved with frontpage = 0 when approved, i.e. only be displayed in the topic [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Avoid emitting an extra &lt;br&gt; tag after the last section in the What's New block (bug #330) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Update comment count in Older Stories block when a new comment is posted (bug #317). Also optimized the code to collect the contents of the Older Stories block [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed extra &lt;br&gt; being emitted in the calendar for events that aren't visible for the current user (bug #268) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>(Event) Admins can now delete events directly from the calendar's day and week views (just like events in the personal calendar) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed usersettings.php so that it displays the "benefits" message again when called up by an anonymous user. Also made it go to the user's preferences when called without a 'mode' parameter [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added {layout_url} to the available theme variables in the submission forms. Also added {separator} for those who prefer correct spelling ;-) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>More parameter filtering and permission checks in submit.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed over-zealous parameter filtering in links.php which prevented categories with apostrophes from working [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed broken URLs when editing a plain-text story that contained uploaded images (reported by LWC) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The PEAR classes that ship with Geeklog actually require PHP 4.2.x now. However, the missing functions in older PHP versions (minimum requirement for Geeklog itself is now PHP 4.1.0) are provided by the PEAR PHP_Compat package, which we will have to ship with Geeklog from now on. Added the necessary code to lib-common.php to load PHP_Compat, if required [Dirk]<br>
  Many thanks to Tom Willet for providing a test setup.</li>
	<li>Fixed "quick add form" for personal events, so that it stores the new event directly now [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of 12am/pm in events, event submissions, and when passing the time from the calendar to the event submission forms [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Improved handling of personal events / personal calendar, especially for (Event) Admins [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed What's Related links when magic_quotes_qpc = on [Vinny, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed use of an undefined variable $U in COM_showBlocks and warning messages for undefined array indexes in COM_getCurrentURL (reported by irawen) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow empty search query strings so that the "More by &lt;author&gt;" and "More
  from &lt;topic&gt;" options work again [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When deleting a poll, also delete any comments to that poll [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Delete comments and story images when deleting stories from a deleted topic (bug #339) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When deleting a story, added an extra check for type='article' when deleting the story's comments [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Set current user as the owner when cloning an event (bug #338) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Start time, end time, and event location weren't copied over when adding a site event to the personal calendar (bug #336) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed wrong use of htmlentities() on comment title (bug #335) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Changed "read more" word count so that it ignores HTML tags (bug #333) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by Ko de Pree.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Ko de Pree.</li>
	<li>New French language files for the Spam-X plugin, provided by Alain Ponton.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nov 28, 2004 (1.3.10)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Allow omission of the link text for the [story:], [event:], and [staticpage:] autotags. Geeklog will then use the title (of the story / event / static page) as the link text [Dirk]<br>
  (affected files: system/lib-plugins.php, plugins/staticpages/functions.inc)</li>
	<li>Updated Chinese language files (all 4 of them), provided by Samuel M. Stone</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nov 21, 2004 (1.3.10rc3)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Changed wording of the error message if the "backups" directory is not writable [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed comments for the DB_result (in lib-database.php) and dbResult (in mysql.class.php) functions (bug #320) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Display a success message when using the "changepw" option in admin/user.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When changing a username, make sure to change the name of the user's photo, too (bug #321) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Links in "plain text" stories and comments are now made clickable (i.e. enclosed in &lt;a&gt; tags) when the post is saved instead of when it's displayed, as in the previous release candidates. This also fixes bug #308. [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added $_CONF['disable_autolinks'] config option to disable autolinks [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed ViewBlacklist.Admin.class.php from the Spam-X plugin [Tom Willet]</li>
	<li>Overhauled handling of personal events [Dirk]:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed deleting personal events (again).</li>
			<li>The upcoming events block now links to the event details of personal events (just like it already did for site events).</li>
			<li>Added stricter checks for permissions, user IDs, and the personal calendars being activated in the first place.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Added a check for allow_url_fopen if reading a (RSS) feed fails and report it in error.log if it is off [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When deleting a story (automatically), make sure we're only deleting comments belonging to that story (i.e. added a check for type = 'article') [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added {event_type}, {lang_event_type}, and {edit_icon} in all the themes' calendar/eventdetails.thtml template file [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed some URLs in the calendar (missing slash) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Comment IDs don't have to be numeric (in comment.php) [Vinny]</li>
	<li>The Static Pages plugin now takes $_CONF['showfirstasfeatured'] into account when displaying static pages in center blocks (reported by eyecravedvd) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Forgot to declare $_CONF as global when fixing bug #301 (bug #302) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Updated Chinese language files (all 4 of them), provided by Samuel M. Stone</li>
	<li>Updated Japanese language files (euc-jp and UTF-8), provided by Yusuke Sakata</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik</li>
	<li>Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape</li>
	<li>Updated Spanish language file, provided by Angel Romero</li>
	<li>Updated Swedish language file, provided by Markus Berg</li>
</ul>

<h2>Oct 24, 2004 (1.3.10rc2)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed plugin update function [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Set the target encoding in Geeklog's RSS parser (bug #301) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Set the {topic_icon} variable to an empty string for the "Home" link in the Topics block (reported by jhwhite) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed News Box Configuration, i.e. the ability to disable blocks [Vinny]</li>
	<li>In the story template files, the number of comments now only is a link when there actually is a comment on the story [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Hard-coded the English word 'delete' in the URLs to delete a comment [Dirk]</li>
	<li>For the list of a user's recent comments, use 'mode=view' to link directly to a comment now [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed comment id in comment notification emails [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed display of the number of static pages that the user has access to (in the Admin Block) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_makeClickableLinks did not recognize links with the 'http:' at the start of a line [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Re-introduced &lt;br&gt; between plugin sections in the What's New block, pretty much reverting the change suggested by feature request #292 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced function COM_formatEmailAddress that creates a (more or less) RFC(2)822 compliant email address from a name and an address [Dirk]<br>
  This function is now used for formatting the site address, as well as for addresses entered by the user in profiles.php and admin/mail.php.</li>
	<li>The Spam-X plugin's MailAdmin action didn't send any email notifications, since the call to COM_mail was commented out ... [Dirk]</li>
	<li>admin/mail.php and admin/group.php use the complete URL to the script in the &lt;form action="..."&gt; now (instead of relying on PHP_SELF) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed parse error in the Dutch language file (reported by NeoNecro) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Allow the dot '.' in IDs (in addition to letters, digits, the dash, and the underscore) [Dirk]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Oct 17, 2004 (1.3.10rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added new functionality to [autotags] - New plugin API's added  [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Added [autotag] hooks for stories  [Bline]</li>
	<li>When a plugin had its icon only in the admin directoy, the plugin editor did not find it and displayed a generic icon instead [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In admin/mail.php, apply htmlspecialchars() on the email addresses before displaying them, as the '&lt;foo@example.com&gt;' part will be interpreted as HTML by some browsers (pointed out by LWC) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When using gdlib for image resizing, GIF images were converted to PNG, but Geeklog was still trying to display the GIF (reported by Tom Willet). Since the LZW patent has now expired (see http://www.unisys.com/about__unisys/lzw), it is safe to use GIF images again, so the PNG conversion was dropped [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed link to the Anonymous user's profile in comment/thread.thtml [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added Location field to the user profile [Blaine]</li>
	<li>In the light of bug #293, removed all variable names from the language files, leaving only the $_CONF config variables [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed an error message when plugins didn't return an array from plugin_getmenuitems_xxx (reported by computerade) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When sending emails from the admin/mail.php, some user's names weren't set in their email address (reported by LWC) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed an extra &lt;br&gt; from before and between data provided by plugins in the What's New block (feature request #292) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When creating a new user from admin/user.php, don't determine the uid before actually creating the database entries to avoid race conditions / collisions with other user accounts created at the same time (bug #243) [Dirk]<br>
  Also took the opportunity to refactor and move the almost identical code from users.php and admin/user.php into a new function USER_createAccount in system/lib-user.php.</li>
	<li>usersettings.php was missing a default case for unsupported values of 'mode' (bug #287). This only displayed a blank page and was not exploitable [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed hard-coded default group names in the Admin sections (e.g. when a user had story.edit permissions but was not in the Story Admin group, any new story created by that user would default to being owned by the Story Admin group nonetheless) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced new plugin API functions plugin_user_changed_xxx and plugin_group_changed_xxx to inform plugins when a user's information (profile or settings) or a group (new, edit, delete) has been changed [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_checkHTML and COM_allowedHTML now accept an additional parameter in form of a comma-separated list of permissions. If the current user has at least one of those permissions, they are assumed to be an "Admin" and the functions will use the $_CONF['admin_html'] list of HTML tags for them (bugs #114 and #118) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_allowedHTML now has an option to only return the list of allowed HTML tags without the "Allowed HTML" text (bug #118) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>For the poll block, always use the block title stored in the database (bug #205) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>It is now again possible to have a different number of stories per page for individual topics. Users have to set their preferred number of stories per page to 0 (zero) in their preferences, though, as the user preferences will always override this setting (bug #190) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The Professional theme, kindly provided by Victor B. Gonzalez, is our new default theme now.</li>
	<li>In the calendar's day and week view, event permissions weren't checked properly, so that some events were displayed to user who shouldn't have been able to see them (reported by Willem Jan) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Don't update a story's hit counter as long as the draft flag is set or the publishing date is in the future (feature request #282) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced new function COM_sanitizeID() to filter special characters out of user-editable IDs as used for stories, polls, topics, and static pages (also fixes bug #181). Allowed characters are letters a-z (both upper and lower case), digits 0-9, the dash '-', and the underscore '_' [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The Upcoming Events block didn't use the help URL, even if it was set (reported by Wolfgang M. Schmitt) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Geeklog now comes with Tom Willet's Spam-X plugin pre-installed. The plugin now stores the blacklists in the database and uses a new plugin API function to filter comment posts [Tom Willet, Tony, Blaine, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Plugins can now offer their own tags to allow easy linking to their content. These tags take the form [name:id link text], where 'name' is a name associated with the plugin, 'id' is a unique id referring to one of the objects under the plugin's control, and 'link text' is text used in the &lt;a&gt; tag that Geeklog creates from these tags. Built-in tags are [story:] to link to a story and [event:] to link to an event [Blaine, Dirk]<br>
  Example: [story:email-bug About the email bug] would be translated into &lt;a href="http://example.com/article.php/email-bug"&gt;About the email bug&lt;/a&gt;</li>
	<li>portal.php now sends a 301 HTTP status code for the links instead of a 302. While a 302 status code would actually make more sense, Google does have a tendency to list search results with the URL of the portal script but with the content of the linked site, thus giving the impression that the content is actually located on another site. Sending a 301 avoids this problem [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Group Admins should not even see the groups of which they are not a member (bug #280) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Prevent Group Admins from listing the members of a group unless they are a member of that group themselves [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced $_CONF['left_blocks_in_footer'] config option that makes the {left_blocks} variable available in footer.thtml (disabling it in header.thtml at the same time). This is really only useful for two-column layouts where you want the side blocks in the right column [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Polls linked from the stats page now display the result of the poll instead of letting the user vote on them (feature request #267) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In the Admin's list of events and stories, don't list items for which the Admin doesn't have read access (bug #269). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Story IDs are now editable (just like the IDs of static pages). [Dirk]<br>
  Important: Update the story editor template (admin/story/storyeditor.thtml)!</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that reset every user's password request as soon as some user changed their account information (bug #265) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added support for URL rewriting to portal.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The links for the What's Related block are stored in the 'related' field in the gl_stories table again. Parsing the story for links every time it is rendered uses too much CPU power (with apologies to groklaw.net) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added theme variable {story_link} to commentbar.thtml to link back to original story the comments are derived from. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Introduced new file system/lib-story.php for story-related functions and moved COM_article, COM_whatsRelated, COM_extractLinks, as well as the code to delete article images into that file (functions were renamed accordingly: STORY_renderArticle, STORY_whatsRelated, STORY_extractLinks) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed URLs to userphotos and story images when $_CONF['path_images'] had been changed (but was still inside of $_CONF['path_html']) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a script to convert an existing database to InnoDB tables (if the MySQL version supports them): admin/install/toinnodb.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added missing closing &lt;/a&gt; tag in story search results (bug #260) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a second parameter to function COM_makeList that is used as a CSS class name in the list it returns (use {list_class_name} to get the actual class name, and {list_class} to get class="classname"). Changed the existing calls to COM_makeList to include class names, so that you can now use the following class names in your stylesheet to style lists: list-feed, list-new-comments, list-new-links, list-new-plugins, list-older-stories, list-personal-events, list-site-events, list-story-options, list-whats-related (the names should be self-explanatory) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Moved the docs directory to public_html/docs and added a link to it from the Admin's block (can be switched off in config.php by setting the new option $_CONF['link_documentation'] = 0) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Replaced 'ppmtojpeg' with 'pnmtojpeg' when using NetPBM for scaling uploaded JPEG images (bug #257) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a check (and a warning message) for PHP 4.1.0 to the install script, as that is our new minimum requirement [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Rewrote install/success.php and added a link to install/check.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added the 'data' and 'pdfs' directory to install/check.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Integrated the "welcome email hack": If the file 'welcome_email.txt' exists in the 'data' directory, the contents of that file are sent out as the welcome email to new users (instead of the hard-coded welcome message) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced a 'data' directory ($_CONF['path_data'], defaulting to /path/to/geeklog/data) and use it for the batch user import, as Geeklog's base directory may not be writable on some setups (bug #77) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Sort list of older polls by date (newest first) and added paging [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Make sure the old userphoto is deleted when uploading a new one (bug #228). So far, the old photo was not removed when the file type changed (e.g. from .gif to .jpg) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Don't assume the uploaded file in usersettings.php is always the userphoto - it may in fact belong to a plugin (bug #179). This bug prevented plugins from uploading their own files through the plugin API [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed repeating events in the personal calendar's day view (bug #232) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_siteHeader() now accepts a page title (to go between the page's &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt; tags) as the second parameter, replacing the $_CONF['pagetitle'] hack (which still works but should be avoided) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In the site's page title, replace the site slogan with more meaningful information, where possible, e.g. "Submit a Story" on the story submission form, "Search Results", etc. (feature request #95) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed deleting events from the personal calendar (bug #199) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Carry over the date and time from the calendar when Admins add a new event (bug #132) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Don't display "Site Events" headline in the Upcoming Events block when personal calendars are off (feature request #151) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed hard-coded am/pm formatted hours from the calendar's day view (calendar/dayview/dayview.thtml) and replaced them with {xx_hour} variables, where 'xx' is 0-23, which will be replaced with the hours formatted according to the $_CONF['timeonly'] config variable [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Themes can now use a couple of CSS class names to style the small calendar (of the previous and next month) in month view: .smallcal, .smallcal-headline, .smallcal-week-even, .smallcal-week-odd, .smallcal-week-empty, .smallcal-day-even, .smallcal-day-odd, and .smallcal-day-empty [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Improvements to the Story Archive Feature, UI tweaks, Language Extraction, Added new field to the topics table. Admin now sets the archive topic in the Topic Editor. Only one topic can be used - logic enforced. [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Don't emit the &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; in article.php when the story's body text is empty (based on patch #147, provided by Andy Maloney) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Set {article_url} variable when displaying the story in article.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed missing &lt;/select&gt; tags for the comment display mode and sort order drop-down menus in usersettings.php (patch #255, provided by machinari) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Hard-coded the names of the pseudo image tags in story.php, i.e. they are always [imageX], [imageX_left], and [imageX_right] now, independent of the current language file (bug #139) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added the Auto-Archive Management feature. Optionally allows the Story Editor to archive or delete a story when the expire date is reached [Blaine]</li>
	<li>Improved the commentbar to logically support comments viewed from comment.php [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Removed a bug in comment.php that allowed a story/comment mismatch during display.  This was not exploitable.  [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Integrated the timezone hack to compensate for time differences when your webserver is located in another timezone (original timezone hack by Yew Loong, with additions by "Joe" as well as several other geeklog.net users) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The calendar can now be configured so that the week starts on either a Sunday or a Monday - see new config variable $_CONF['week_start']<br>
  (based on a patch by bond_anton) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Sort the admin's list of events by date (newest first). Also added paging, a row number and parameter filtering. Paging and the row number require theme changes in admin/event/eventlist.thtml and listitem.thtml [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Incorporated a patch provided by Drago Goricanec to sort the Admin's user list by uid [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced 2 config options for the Who's Online block:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>$_CONF['whosonline_fullname'] will display the user's full name,</li>
			<li>$_CONF['whosonline_anonymous'] does not display the names of registered users to anonymous visitors of the site.</li>
		</ul><br>
  <p>Both options are disabled by default [Dirk]</p></li>
	<li>Added support for single quotes and nested tags to COM_extractLinks [Vinny]</li>
	<li>The admin_html and user_html are now merged recursively (bug #240) [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Remove colons from email addresses, as they have a special meaning, according to RFC(2)822, that we didn't intend (bug #6) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed compilation of regexp if the search query ended or started with a space (the resulting error message would also expose the path to article.php), (bug #251) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Sort the admin's list of polls by date (newest first). Also added paging, a row number and parameter filtering. Paging and the row number require theme changes in admin/poll/polllist.thtml and listitem.thtml [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added paging to the plugin editor (for more than 25 installed plugins). A {google_paging} variable is needed in admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml for the paging links to show up [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Emails sent from the Admin's mail form (admin/mail.php) were always sent with the site name and site email address, even if you entered something else in the form. Also made admin/mail/mailform.thtml slightly less ugly [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When deleting a topic, keep the blocks assigned to that topic (bug #247). They're assigned to 'all topics' and disabled, but kept around now. The same applies for topic feeds, which weren't handled at all before [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Make sure upload errors for user photos and story images are displayed in a Geeklog block, not on a blank screen [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed description of DB_insertId() in lib-database.php and dbInsertId() in mysql.class.php: The functions take a resource, describing the opened link to the database, not a record set (pointed out by lgonze on IRC). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Plugins are now getting the key type passed to their search function, so that they can perform a search for "exact phrase", "all of these words", or "any of these words" as selected from the search form. [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Use URL rewriting for the link to a story's printer-friendly version, when activated (bug #201) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Resizing an image didn't work when the image height exceeded the max. height but the image width was still below the max. width (bug #242) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Keeping the unscaled image when using GDlib didn't work (bug #197) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added a workaround for the Zeus webserver so that blocks marked "homeonly" properly appear there (bug #244) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Previewing a story submission from admin/story.php before saving it left the original story submission in the submission queue while also adding it as a new story. This has been fixed now [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added {article_url} variable for article/printable.thtml so that we can print the proper URL to the article if URL rewriting is on [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added filtering for the $order parameter in article.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added {link_actual_url} variable in links.php, holding the actual URL of a link (not Geeklog's redirect URL via portal.php). Updated template file links/linkdetails.thtml in all default themes to use {link_actual_url} in a title attribute for the links [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The event description now honors linefeeds to allow some basic text formatting [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Escape all PCRE special characters in the code to highlight search query words (bug #200). Also moved the code to its own function, COM_highlightQuery, in lib-common.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The contents and order of the menu entries, i.e. of the {menu_elements} variable in header.thtml, is now configurable in config.php (new config variable $_CONF['menu_elements']). It also includes an option to add custom entries by implementing a function CUSTOM_menuEntries() that returns the additional entries [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Use an UPDATE request when increasing the number of times a story has been emailed [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When an error occurs while creating a backup, the complete command line used to call mysqldump is now added to error.log [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added 'view' mode to allow links directly to a single comment (and optionally its children) in comments.php.  [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Added a few variables to be used in the eventdetails.thtml template file:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>{event_state_name} (full name of the state), {event_state_only} and</li>
			<li>{event_state_name_only} (abbreviated and full state name without the comma),</li>
			<li>{event_edit} (link to edit the event, if allowed for the current user),</li>
			<li>{edit_icon} (same, but with the edit icon instead of a text link),</li>
			<li>{lang_event_type} and {event_type} for the event type [Dirk]</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Registered users can now report abusive comments to the site admin (inspired by Feature Request #171, which actually requested this for the forums). Requires new text strings in the language files and a new template file, comment/reportcomment.thtml [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Bugfix: New users created through the batch import didn't get the email with their password [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Moved function to create and send a password to lib-user.php to avoid having identical code in users.php, admin/user.php, and admin/moderation.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added {topic_image} variable (available in the topicoption.thtml and topicoption_off.thtml template files) so that you can use topic images in the Topics block (feature request #152) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_undoSpecialChars() now also handles &amp;nbsp; (bug #192) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of HTML entities in [code] sections (bug #159) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added an option to look up IP addresses (new variable $_CONF['ip_lookup'] in config.php, pointing to a service that does IP address lookups) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with the database backup when there were spaces in the path to the backups directory (bug #185). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added email notification for new comments (feature request #155) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added tracking of IP addresses of comment posters (as suggested by Michael Jervis) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Altered COM_article to improve performance by reducing queries. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Reduced DB queries in COM_showTopics to improve performance. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Cached enabled plugins to reduce db queries and improve performance. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Fixed SEC_inGroup not using $_GROUPS cache in several instances. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>mysql.class.php now only runs mysql_connect once per page load.  [Vinny]</li>
	<li>The "Google paging" now has additional links to jump to the first and last page (patch provided by Niels Leenheer). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced function COM_makeClickableLinks to turn URLs in text-only posts into clickable links (i.e. it's adding &lt;a&gt; tags around URLs). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Changed the comment insert, delete, display algorithms for improved efficiency. They now use a modified preorder tree traversal method. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Comment limit now applies to all the comments displayed, not just the top level comments. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Added pagination ability to comments ({pagenav} template variable in startcomment.thtml). [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Fixed typo in timer.class.php that broke the ->restart() function. [Vinny]</li>
	<li>Make sure the database backup files are always sorted by (last modified) date (found &amp; fixed by Alexander Schmacks). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Make sure the user's preferred comment limit is used when changing the comment display via the comment bar (bug #176). [Vinny]</li>
	<li>When URL rewriting is activated, the "rewritten" URLs are now also used in all (RSS) feeds containing links to articles. [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Experimental: On a fresh install, use InnoDB tables (instead of MyISAM) if the MySQL version running on the server supports them (usually as of MySQL 4.0). This should avoid locks on tables where hit counters and the actual data are stored in the same table, e.g. stories (suggested by Marc Von Ahn). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in the install script when upgrading from 1.3.8 or earlier: Check to see if the static pages plugin is installed before attempting to update its tables (reported by Rob Griffiths). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Implemented a change to DB_fetchArray, suggested by Niels Leenheer: Geeklog will now, by default, only return associative array indices. In case the numeric indices are needed, a new (optional) second parameter for DB_fetchArray has to be set to "true". [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Removed extra quotes in SQL statements in admin/block.php to ensure compatibility with old MySQL versions (reported by Elmer Masters). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>In admin/database.php, if the is_executable function is not available (e.g. on Windows), do at least a file_exists to check if the mysqldump executable exists in the path given in config.php. [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Introduced function COM_getTopicSQL which returns part of an SQL request to check for a user's topic access [Dirk]<br>
  (This was actually introduced in 1.3.9sr1 but missing from the changelog)</li>
</ul>

<p>Language files</p>
<ul>
	<li>New Bosnian language file, provided by Kenan Hodzic</li>
	<li>Updated Croatian language file, provided by Roberto Bilic</li>
	<li>New Indonesian language file, provided by Piotr Sobis</li>
	<li>Updated Norwegian language file, provided by Torfinn Ingolfsen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Static Pages Plugin 1.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a printable version for static pages (based on a concept by Jannetta S Lewis). Requires a new template file, printable.thtml, located in the static pages' template directory [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added support for autolinks and provide a [staticpage:] autotag [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added an option to sort the static pages that are added to a site's menu (see {plg_menu_elements} in header.thtml) by id, label, title, or date [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The block templates used to wrap a static page in a block can now be overridden, using '_staticpages_block' and '_staticpages_centerblock' as the index for the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE array [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The plugin now checks for template files in the current theme's directory (layout/THEMENAME/staticpages) first before using the default template files from plugin/staticpages/templates [Dirk]</li>
	<li>When displaying a static page, the plugin no longer checks if the current user is a member of the Root group, so that "Root" users shouldn't see static pages that are for anonymous users only [Dirk]<br>
  This change was actually supposed to be in Static Pages 1.4 (Geeklog 1.3.9), but somehow didn't make it ...</li>
	<li>For center blocks, ignore the "blank page" setting, unless it's for a page that is supposed to replace the entire frontpage (bug #234) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The static pages editor doesn't display a "delete" button for new and cloned pages any more (since, obviously, you can't delete what hasn't been saved yet ...). [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Bugfix: Fresh installs of Geeklog 1.3.9 only allowed 20 characters for the static page ID, while installs upgraded from an earlier version allowed up to 40 characters [Dirk]</li>
	<li>New Portuguese (Brazil) language file, provided by Alcides Soares Filho.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mar 5, 2006 (1.3.9sr5)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Konstantin Dyakoff found an old bug in the session handling that would allow anyone to log in as any user.</li>
	<li>James Bercegay of GulfTech Security Research reported several issues with Geeklog's cookie handling that made it vulnerable to SQL injections, arbitrary file access, and even injection and execution of arbitrary code.</li>
	<li>Prevent execution of PHP code in "normal" blocks</li>
</ul>


<h2>Jul 3, 2005 (1.3.9sr4)</h2>

<p>Stefan Esser found an SQL injection that can, under certain circumstances, be exploited to extract user data such as the user's password hash.</p>


<h2>Dec 31, 2004 (1.3.9sr3)</h2>

<p>This release addresses 2 security issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It was possible to submit stories anonymously even if anonymous submissions were turned off in config.php (reported by Barry Wong). These stories still ended up in the submission queue, though, unless you disabled it in config.php.</li>
	<li>Some of the parameters in link and event submissions weren't filtered, leaving them open to potential SQL injections.</li>
</ol>

<p>This release addresses 2 security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the $topic variable in the language files ($LANG05[3]) where it should have been using '%s' instead (bug #293) [Vinny, Dirk]</li>
	<li>It was possible to post comments to stories or polls for which comment posting had been switched off [Dirk]<br>
  This was only a problem if you allowed anonymous posts or when spammers went through the trouble of actually signing up for an account before posting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-security related fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed lib-plugins.php to be compatible with PHP 5 [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Includes updated PEAR packages to resolve email problems some users were having (especially with safe_mode being on).</li>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It was possible to post anonymous comments, even when anonymous comment posting had been switched off in config.php [Vinny, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Added additional speed limit checks for comments and submissions [Vinny]</li>
	<li>It was still possible to read the comments to stories, even when the user didn't have access to the story's topic (provided they knew the story id) [Vinny, Dirk]</li>
	<li>If none of the topics were visible for anonymous users, the site's index page may still have displayed some stories for anonymous users, depending on the stories' permissions [Vinny, Dirk]</li>
	<li>Users still got Daily Digest emails for topics from which they had been removed (bug #178) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>It was possible to subscribe to the Daily Digest for all topics, even if the user did not have access to certain topics [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Don't list stories or comments in the user profile if the current user isn't allowed to see the topics they were posted under (bug #208) [Dirk]</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-security related fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an SQL error in COM_showTopics if users excluded topics in their preferences (reported by Rob Young) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed sporadic "Duplicate entry '...' for key 1." messages in error.log (caused by the handling of pseudo-session ids for anonymous users) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>Fixed incorrect author names in Daily Digest (bug #207) [Dirk]</li>
	<li>The plugin_profileblocksedit_&lt;plugin-name&gt; Plugin API function wasn't working due to a missing piece of code in usersettings.php [Dirk]</li>
	<li>COM_extractLinks will now ignore anchor tags that do not contain "href" (bug #183) [Vinny]</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mar 14, 2004 (1.3.9)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Custom Registration function hook to custom_useredit added in the edituser() when creating a new user from the admin screen. The custom function was not being called if this was a new user [file: admin/user.php].</li>
	<li>Fixed wrong use of DB_count in COM_showPoll in lib-common.php. This may have prevented people from voting on other polls once they voted on any poll on a site [file: lib-common.php].</li>
	<li>Updated Danish language file, provided by ZooN.</li>
	<li>Updated Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel (please note that this file was made for 1.3.8-1 and is missing a few of the texts added in 1.3.9).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mar 7, 2004 (1.3.9rc3)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed call to CUSTOM_mail and added a sample implementation in lib-custom.php (commented out by default).</li>
	<li>Made an attempt to recover from duplicate session ids for anonymous users.</li>
	<li>Adding new topics always resulted in a "Please fill in the Topic ID and Topic Name fields" error message, even if you did fill in both fields (this bug was only introduced in 1.3.9rc2).</li>
	<li>Filter out backslashes.</li>
	<li>Comment titles were cut off at the first single or double quote (when submitting a new comment).</li>
	<li>The text string $LANG04[89] in all language files must be enclosed in double quotes, not single quotes.</li>
	<li>Updated Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel.</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik.</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Robert Stadnik</li>

	<li>Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.</li>
	<li>Included UTF-8 versions of the Croatian and Japanese language files, provided by Samuel Stone.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Feb 29, 2004 (1.3.9rc2)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The new Admin interface for handling blocks (introduced in 1.3.9rc1) will renumber the block order in steps of 10, which can lead to order numbers &gt; 255 if you have many blocks. Changed the 'blockorder' field in the "gl_blocks" table from TINYINT to SMALLINT to compensate.<br>
  If you are upgrading from 1.3.9rc1, you will need to run the following SQL request manually:<br>
      <code>ALTER TABLE gl_blocks CHANGE blockorder blockorder smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL default '1';</code><br>
  Replacing "gl_blocks" with the proper table name, if you are using a table prefix other than 'gl_'. This step is not necessary when upgrading from 1.3.8 or earlier versions.</li>
	<li>The Group Admin restrictions introduced in 1.3.9rc1 didn't even let the Admin assign unassigned features to groups (e.g. there was no way to add the staticpages.PHP feature to the Static Page Admin group on a fresh 1.3.9rc1 install).</li>
	<li>When normal users tried to submit an event, they were redirected to the story submission form (this bug was only introduced in 1.3.9rc1).</li>
	<li>Cosmetic changes in the beautifying of language names (in the user's preferences).</li>
	<li>Fixed COM_extractLinks to work with links that follow [IMAGE] tags and more generally handle the extraction of links better and more efficiently.</li>
	<li>If a function CUSTOM_mail() exists, it will be called instead of COM_mail(), to allow users to implement their own function to send emails, if necessary.</li>
	<li>The Static Pages plugin now supports the "exact phrase", "all of these words", and "any of these words" search options.</li>
	<li>Included a simplified custom registration example and made the naming convention for the custom registration functions more consistent.</li>
	<li>Fixed display problems with comments in nested and threaded mode. Please note that the template file comment/comment.thtml has changed (again) since 1.3.9rc1!</li>
	<li>Don't rely on the Who's Online block being active when handling sessions for anonymous users.</li>
	<li>Removed some unused code that handled the obsolete "layout" blocks.</li>
	<li>Try to guess the correct path separator when running on PHP &lt; 4.3.0.</li>
	<li>When upgrading from a pre-1.3.9 install, the install script choked on single quotes in the site name or site slogan.</li>
	<li>More parameter filtering.</li>
	<li>Included UTF-8 versions of the English, German, Finnish, and Chinese (traditional and simplified) language files, provided by Samuel Stone.</li>
	<li>Added new Croatian language file, provided by Roberto Bilic.</li>
	<li>Added new Finnish language file, provided by Jussi Josefsson.</li>
	<li>Added new Hebrew language file, provided by Tal Vizel.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by Wim Niemans.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Feb 16, 2004 (1.3.9rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use COM_getYearFormOptions() etc. for the event submission form in submit.php, thus avoiding duplicated code.</li>
	<li>Plugins can now add their new entries to the What's New block by implementing the new plugin_whatsnewsupported and plugin_getwhatsnew API functions.<br>
  This section can be enabled/disabled with the new $_CONF['hidenewplugins'] config variable.</li>
	<li>When a user is deleted, make sure we assign any objects that require Admin access (blocks, topics, ...) to a user from the Root group.</li>
	<li>Slightly revamped the install script and made it catch (or silently ignore) the most popular problems with the path to Geeklog ...</li>
	<li>Removed the hard-coded &amp;nbsp; from {welcome_msg} and added it to the header.thtml of the Classic, XSilver, and Yahoo themes (the other themes either look fine without it or didn't use {welcome_msg} anyway).</li>
	<li>Added a missing stripslashes() call for link titles returned from a search.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug when highlighting search queries that contained a '*' (reported by wlparks).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug/typo introduced in 1.3.8-1sr4 that prevented you from deleting story submissions from the Admin's story editor (reported by James Bothe).</li>
	<li>Changed all url fields in the database to hold up to 255 characters per URL. Please note that the template files in most themes will limit the max. number of characters to 96 or 128 characters. See docs/theme.html for more information on how to update the themes.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems batch-importing users with single quotes in their names (bug #141).</li>
	<li>The permissions for the "Group Admin" group have been changed such that members of that group now only have access to groups of which they themselves are a member of. When creating new groups, the rights (permissions) to chose from are also limited to those that the Group Admin users have themselves. These changes should make the Group Admin group more useful.<br>
  Note: Group admins can still see all the existing groups and who is a member of those groups.</li>
	<li>Fixed search class so that the simplified and the advanced search return the same results (as long as none of the advanced options are used).</li>
	<li>Added new config variable $_CONF['allowed_protocols'] which lets you specify the protocols that are allowed to be used in a link (feature request #109).<br>
  Note: The kses class has a hard-coded list of allowed protocols to which the above will be added. It is currently not possible to remove any of the predefined protocols.</li>
	<li>Introduced variable {allowed_menu_elements} in header.thtml which only includes those menu elements that the current user is allowed to use (i.e. honoring the $_CONF['XXXloginrequired'] settings).</li>
	<li>COM_accessLog() now logs the user's uid and IP address automatically.</li>
	<li>The option to stay logged in for 1 year has been removed and an option to not stay logged in (after the session has expired) has been added.</li>
	<li>Fixed display of default blocks in the user preferences.</li>
	<li>If the user chose not to see certain topics (by selecting them from the "Excluded Items" list in the preferences) then don't list those topics in the Topics block.</li>
	<li>After saving your account information, you are now redirected to your profile page, so that you can see your changes as they would be displayed for other users of the site.</li>
	<li>Integrated Vincent Furia's patches to use Geeklog's URL rewriting for links to stories (i.e. article.php).</li>
	<li>In the story templates, you can now use {article_url} as the URL to the article.php with the current story (e.g. for a "link to this story" link).</li>
	<li>There is a new file, system/lib-user.php, for user-related code that is used by usersettings.php, admin/user.php, and admin/moderation.php.</li>
	<li>All template files that let you enter a URL are now using {max_url_length} for the maxlength attribute.</li>
	<li>Access to admin/mail.php is now granted to all users with 'user.mail' permissions (previously, users with that permission without being in the 'Mail Admin' group would see the "Mail Users" entry in the Admin block but were refused access to it).</li>
	<li>The list of group names in the Mail Users form is now sorted alphabetically.</li>
	<li>Any unauthorized attempts to access the admin pages are now properly logged in access.log.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems when resizing userphotos for user names that have spaces in them (reported by Per on geeklog-users).</li>
	<li>Now accomodate strict webhosts who don't allow file uploads to the standard image directory, you can now set a new configuration variable, $_CONF['path_images'] to point to a directory outside of your webtree where article images and user profile pictures will be saved and served from.</li>
	<li>Don't append a '-' to the page title if $_CONF['site_slogan'] is empty (feature request #88).</li>
	<li>COM_getMonthFormOptions() now always lists the month names instead of only the numbers. COM_getYearFormOptions() also lists the previous year.</li>
	<li>Changed admin/event.php to use the COM_getMonthFormOptions() etc. functions from lib-common.php, thus avoiding duplicated code.</li>
	<li>In the calendar/calendar.thtml template file, you can now use {start_block} and {end_block} to wrap the calendar in a block.</li>
	<li>Fixed a few display problems in case of errors in calendar_event.php. Also made calendar.php display messages sent from calendar_event.php.</li>
	<li>Make sure the custom registration form is properly called from all relevent places (bug #57).</li>
	<li>Single quotes are now silently stripped from topic IDs (bug #113).</li>
	<li>Fixed search displaying all the links for an empty search string, e.g. when searching for "more from" some user (bug #87).</li>
	<li>Fixed link from search results that contained a '/' (bug #115).</li>
	<li>Comments from a story that has been marked as "draft" are no longer returned from a search (bug #128).</li>
	<li>The Admin's link list now uses "google paging", 50 links per page (bug #104).<br>
  Note: Requires a change in the admin/link/linklist.thtml template file.</li>
	<li>(Block)Admins can now change the order of blocks and enable / disable blocks directly from the Admin's list of blocks (based on a concept by stratosfear).</li>
	<li>An alternative interface to adding (multiple) users to a group is now available from the Admin's list of groups. This feature requires JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Fixed display of permissions in the "Access" column of the Admin's list of stories (didn't take Topic permissions into account).</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of "0" as a poll answer (bug #73).</li>
	<li>Added a check and warning message in admin/moderation.php if register_globals is "off".</li>
	<li>Changed function COM_isEmail() to use PEAR::Mail/RFC822 to check for valid email addresses.</li>
	<li>Added an edit icon to each theme (images/edit.gif). Variable {edit_icon} can be used as an alternative to {edit_link}, i.e. as an icon that Story Admins can click on to edit a story.</li>
	<li>You can now enable debug messages (to error.log) for the image upload by setting $_CONF['debug_image_upload'] = true in config.php.</li>
	<li>When deleting a group, delete all references to that group from the group_assignments table (bug #50). The install script will remove any orphaned entries when upgrading the database to 1.3.9.</li>
	<li>The option to delete comments was only available to users in the Root group (e.g. Admin). Since comments don't have permissions, comments can now be deleted by users with Story Admin permissions for the story they are commenting on (or Poll Admin permissions for comments on polls; bug #27).</li>
	<li>Display a generic (and localised) error message when there is a problem importing an (RSS) feed - details will be available in error.log. Also checks for empty (but existing) feeds now.</li>
	<li>When the user submission queue is activated, you now have an "edit" link that takes you to the Admin's user editor (the profile link is now on the username). Contributed by Ed Magin.</li>
	<li>COM_siteHeader() now uses output buffering for the eval(), preventing the header from being output directly.<br>
  Note: This may require changes in 3rd party scripts, e.g. the Geeklog/Gallery integration.</li>
	<li>The install script will set the 'date' field for links to sensible values now (reconstructed from the date that's encoded in the link id).</li>
	<li>The author exclusion list in the preferences is now a (multi-select) listbox.</li>
	<li>A proper error message is now displayed if the Admin creates a new user or changes an existing account with an email address that already exists (that test was already introduced in 1.3.8-1 but the error message was confusing), thus closing bug #24. Also checks for valid email addresses now.</li>
	<li>You can now use {author_fullname} and {author_photo} variables in comment templates (feature request #35).</li>
	<li>Remove extra backslashes from new links in What's New block (bug #59).</li>
	<li>The [code] tag is now displayed in the list of allowed HTML tags.</li>
	<li>Image upload can now use the GD library (contributed by Rob Coenen). If possible, GIF images will be converted to PNGs during upload. However, some versions of the GD library may not allow to read GIF images at all.</li>
	<li>Geeklog now uses PEAR::Mail to send all emails. In config.php, you can select whether emails should be sent via PHP's mail() function, sendmail, or SMTP.</li>
	<li>Introduced /path/to/geeklog/system/pear as the directory to hold the PEAR packages used by Geeklog. Currently, those are PEAR, Mail, Net_SMTP, and Net_Socket. These packages will be included in the releases from now on.</li>
	<li>Introduced function COM_mail(). From now on, all Geeklog email will be sent from this function (instead of using PHP's mail() function directly).</li>
	<li>When users try to register with an empty username or invalid email address, make sure we're displaying a custom registration form (if one exists) when displaying the error message (part 1 of bug #57).</li>
	<li>Prevent users from registering with an empty username (bug #56).</li>
	<li>Use $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault'] when batch-adding users. Until now, new users were subscribed to the Daily Digest automatically (bug #55).</li>
	<li>Added an 'edit' link to links/linkdetails.thtml, so that (Link) Admins can edit links easily (contributed by Euan McKay).</li>
	<li>What's Related applied COM_checkHTML() on the entire block instead of on the individual items, thus stripping out HTML from the template file (bug #52).</li>
	<li>Words from a search query are now properly highlighted in comments when the words occured only in the comments (but not in the story).</li>
	<li>Integrated Vincent Furia's new comment code to use templates for comments (instead of hard-coded HTML).<br>
  New template files: comment/comment.thtml, comment/thread.thtml.</li>
</ul>

<p>Updated: comment/startcomment.thtml</p>
<ul>
	<li>New Admin interface for content syndication (RSS feeds etc.). This lets you create feeds for all the stories and per topic as well as for links and (upcoming) events. Plugins can also provide feeds (through extensions of the Plugin API). Additional feed formats (other than RSS 0.91) can be implemented as new classes (xxx.feed.class.php). Includes new admin/syndication template directory.</li>
	<li>Don't display the "delete" button in the Admin's Event editor when we're editing a new event (reported by Simon Lord).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Static Pages Plugin 1.4</h3>

	<li>It is now possible to disable the use of PHP in static pages entirely by setting $_SP_CONF['allow_php'] = 0 in the static pages' config.php file. If you don't plan on using PHP in static pages, it is recommended that you do that as an additional security measure.</li>
	<li>You can now use "plain PHP" code in a static page, i.e. it doesn't need to be written such that it returns all output in a 'return' statement. The PHP checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown menu offering "do not execute PHP", "execute PHP (return)" [that's the old way], and "execute PHP" [new].</li>
	<li>The ID of a static page can now have up to 40 characters.</li>
	<li>When displaying a static page, the plugin no longer checks if the current user is a member of the Root group, so that "Root" users shouldn't see static pages that are for anonymous users only.</li>
	<li>The option to wrap static pages in a block can now be applied to each page individually. $_SP_CONF['in_block'] is only used as the default setting for new pages.</li>
	<li>Static pages to be displayed after the featured story (in a center block) are now displayed even if there is no featured story (after the static pages to be displayed at the top of the page).</li>
	<li>Static pages are not wrapped in a block when the page format is set to "blank page" (bug #60).</li>
	<li>Added a "Cancel" button in the static pages editor.</li>
	<li>Bugfix: Depending on the permission settings, the "Edit" link was sometimes displayed for users without them having edit permissions for the static page. It wasn't possible to edit the page, though, but the link shouldn't have been there in the first place.</li>
	<li>For security reasons, the Static Page Admin group does not include 'staticpages.PHP' permissions by default any more.</li>
	<li>When a user is deleted, static pages created by that user can now either be deleted or assigned to a Root user (see $_SP_CONF['delete_pages'] option).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see docs/staticpages.html for details.</p>


<h2>Oct 8, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr6)</h2>

<p>This release addresses 2 security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a cross site scripting vulnerability caused by using the $topic variable in the language files ($LANG05[3]) where it should have been using '%s' instead (bug #293) [Vinny, Dirk]<br>
  Note: german.php was not affected and is therefore not included.</li>
	<li>It was possible to post comments to stories or polls for which comment posting had been switched off [Dirk]<br>
  This was only a problem if you allowed anonymous posts or when spammers went through the trouble of actually signing up for an account before posting.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Jun 1, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr5)</h2>

<p>This release fixes a bug due to which it was possible to post anonymous  even when anonymous comment posting had been switched off in .php.</p>

<p>To upgrade from Geeklog 1.3.8-1sr4 to 1.3.8-1sr5, simply upload the included .php, replacing the file of the same name on your webserver.</p>


<h2>January 26, 2004 (1.3.8-1sr4)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It was possible for users in the Group Admin and User Admin groups to become a member of the Root group (reported by Samuel M. Stone, bug #135).</li>
	<li>Being admin for a certain area (e.g. Story Admin for stories) made it possible to delete all objects in that area (e.g. stories) even if the user was not supposed to have access to them, provided the id of the object was known.</li>
	<li>It was possible to delete other people's personal events if you knew the event ID.</li>
	<li>It was possible to browse through the comments of a story even if the user did not have access to the actual story (reported by Peter Roozemaal).</li>
	<li>Due to an XSS issue, it was possible to change someone's account settings (including the password) if you got them to click on a specially crafted link (reported by Jelmer, fix suggested by Vincent Furia).</li>
	<li>The comment display suffered from the possibility of an SQL injection (reported by Jelmer).</li>
	<li>It was possible to inject Javascript code in the calendar (reported by Jelmer).</li>
	<li>It was possible to execute (but not save) Javascript code in the comment preview (reported by Jelmer).</li>
</ol>

<h2>December 5, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr3)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security-related issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>As "dr.wh0" pointed out, the category field for link submissions was not filtered at all. Although you probably can't cause too much harm with those 32 characters, this has now been fixed.</li>
	<li>Vincent Furia found that the restrictions for the form to email users could be circumvented and could even be used to spam users.<br>
   In addition to fixing theses issues, there is now also a speed limit on that form (defaults to the speed limit for story submissions).</li>
	<li>There was a way to post comments anonymously even when posting for anonymous users had been disabled.</li>
	<li>It was possible to post comments under someone else's username.</li>
</ol>

<h2>October 14, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr2)</h2>

<p>Jouko Pynnonen found a way to trick the new "forgot password" feature, in 1.3.8, into letting an attacker change the password for _any_. This release addresses this issue - there were no other changes.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to do is to replace the file users.php on your site the file that comes with this tarball. It's suggested that you change the version number in your config.php to '1.3.8-1sr2' afterwards.</p>

<p>Please note that only Geeklog 1.3.8, 1.3.8-1, and 1.3.8-1sr1 are affected, as this feature did not exist in earlier versions.</p>


<h2>October 12, 2003 (1.3.8-1sr1)</h2>

<p>This release is intended to address some of the security issues reported in September and early October 2003.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Includes Ulf Harnhammar's kses HTML filter to address possible Javascript injections and CSS defacements.</li>
	<li>When upgrading from an earlier version, please make sure to copy over the $_CONF['user_html'] and $_CONF['admin_html'] arrays from the included config.php to your own copy of that file.</li>
	<li>While almost all of the alleged SQL injection issues could not be reproduced, this release includes an update to the MySQL class to not report SQL errors in the browser any more (but only in Geeklog's error.log). This will avoid disclosing any sensitive information as part of the error message.<br>

   Please note that at the moment we do NOT recommend to use Geeklog with MySQL 4.1 (which, at the time of this writing, is in alpha state and should not be used on production sites anyway).<br>

   An upcoming release of Geeklog will address the remaining SQL issues, including any problems with MySQL 4.1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other fixes (not security-related):</p>
<ul>
	<li>When trying to guess the value of $_CONF['cookiedomain'], we need to remove the port number from the URL, if there is one (bug #75).</li>
	<li>The full 1.3.8-1sr1 tarball also includes updated French (Canada) and Turkish language files.</li>
</ul>


<h2>August 9, 2003 (1.3.8-1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When upgrading, the install script will now default the version selection to the last version in the list (currently: 1.3.7) instead of the first one (1.2.5-1).</li>
	<li>Don't allow HTML in static page titles (bug #26).</li>
	<li>Display the search form again if the query returned no results.</li>
	<li>Make sure we're not attempting to send a Daily Digest email to Anonymous.</li>
	<li>Prevent admin from changing a user's email address to one that's already used by someone else (bug #24). The error message you get when you try this may be confusing, though ("The username you tried saving already exists.") since I don't want to introduce new texts in the language file at this point. To be corrected later.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with the cookie timeout: When a user edited his/her profile for the first time, the cookie timeout defaulted to 1 hour, while the default in config.php was usually much longer (default: 1 week). So after editing their profile for the first time, users didn't stay logged in as long as before (unless they noticed that and changed the cookie timeout accordingly themselves).</li>
	<li>Fixed problems in the install script when trying to find out the MySQL version number.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem collecting links for the What's Related block when the article contained (uploaded) images.</li>
	<li>Words from a search query are now hightlighted in comments as well.</li>
	<li>You can now use variables {rss_url} and {rdf_file} in both the site header and footer. Both variables hold the URL to the RSS feed.</li>
	<li>Fixed an occassional "call to member function of non-object" error message in lib-plugins.php.</li>
	<li>Make sure the RSS feed and Older Stories block are updated when a story is deleted.</li>
	<li>The language selection will only list files that end in .php and do not start with a '.'.</li>
	<li>Fixed links to a user's comments from the Last 10 Comments block in the user profile.</li>
	<li>Removed '&amp;query=' from links in search results if the query was empty.</li>
	<li>Anonymous users couldn't use the advanced search even if $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] was not set.</li>
	<li>Fix to disallow access to the extended search for anonymous users (i.e. $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] works again as it did in 1.3.7)</li>
	<li>Fixed search by date.</li>
	<li>Template variable {uid_value} was always empty in the user's profile edit form (in usersettings.php).</li>
	<li>New French (Canada) language file, provided by Jean-Francois Allard.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by W. Niemans.</li>
	<li>Updated Bulgarian language file, provided by Vassil Simeonov and Itso Banov.</li>
	<li>Updated Spanish language file, provided by Angel Romero.</li>
	<li>New French (Canada) language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Jean-Francois Allard.</li>
	<li>New Dutch language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by W. Niemans.</li>
</ul>


<h2>July 17, 2003 (1.3.8)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added Blaine's sample code for the custom registration to lib-custom.php (there's also an accompanying sample template file, memberdetail.thtml).</li>
	<li>"No new links" wasn't displayed in the What's New block when you didn't have any links in the database or when the current user didn't have access to any of them (reported by krove).</li>
	<li>Applied a patch by Tatsumi Imai to fix problems with Japanese characters when editing polls (bug #17).</li>
	<li>Hide those story submissions from moderators that don't have access to the topic.</li>
	<li>Use $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['PATH_INFO'] instead of $PATH_INFO for the url_rewrite feature, since the latter doesn't seem to work on some setups (reported by Peter Sieradzki).</li>
	<li>Updated Slovenian language file, provided by gape.</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Robert Stadnik</li>
</ul>

<h2>July 6, 2003 (1.3.8rc2)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When failing to delete an image for a story (from the Admin's story editor), only log this problem in the error.log but don't abort the script (reported by Rob).</li>
	<li>When editing a story that used double quotes in the title, the title was cut off after the first quote sign.</li>
	<li>Story Admins could edit stories in a topic they didn't have access to, if they somehow found out the story id.</li>
	<li>When $_CONF['listdraftstories'] was enabled, moderation.php listed all stories that had the "draft" flag set without checking for topic permissions (this option was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1).</li>
	<li>For Story Admins, the Admin menu may have listed a greater number of stories than the user actually had access to (didn't check for topic permissions).</li>
	<li>Fixed "Google paging" on the Admin's list of stories when the current user didn't have access to all the topics (paging was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1).</li>
	<li>Try to prevent "illegal access" messages in error.log, caused by the plugin page looking for uninstalled plugins.</li>
	<li>Upcoming events (in the block of the same name) are now sorted by start date and start time, which makes more sense than the old start date, end date sort order (reported by Peter Sieradzki).</li>
	<li>Fixed description of function DB_count() in lib-database.php (reported by jose on IRC).</li>
	<li>Changed the "getBent" block to test the real admin directory in case it has been renamed (bug #762881).</li>
	<li>Saving the user profile also saved the privacy options, setting them all to "off" (reported by Dwight Trumbower).</li>
	<li>Check the topic permissions when doing a search on stories and comments.</li>
	<li>Check the topic permissions when displaying the new stories and comments in the What's New block.</li>
	<li>Need to use date_sub() in the SQL request for the display=new mode on the index page to ensure compatibility with old versions of MySQL (reported by Markus Guske).</li>
	<li>New users created manually from the Admin's User menu were assigned a random password, even when the Admin entered one (reported by TechFan).<br>
  This bug was only introduced in 1.3.8rc1.</li>
	<li>The printer-friendly version of a story in HTML format should not call nl2br() on the story text (bug #762636).</li>
	<li>When attempting to edit a submission, check that it still exists in the submission queue (since another Admin could already have handled it), avoiding an SQL error (reported by Simon Lord).</li>
	<li>New language file for formal German (addressing the user as "Sie" instead of "Du"), provided by Philip Sack.</li>
	<li>Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65.</li>
	<li>Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata.</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik.</li>
	<li>Updated Spanish language file, provided by Angel Romero.</li>
	<li>Updated Swedish language file, provided by Markus Berg.</li>
	<li>New formal German language file for the Static Pages plugin.</li>
	<li>New Italian language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by quess65.</li>
	<li>New Japanese language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Yusuke Sakata.</li>
	<li>New Swedish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Markus Berg</li>
</ul>


<h2>June 29, 2003 (1.3.8rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed SQL error when using quotes in a group description.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where blocks assigned to a topic disappeared when viewing articles.</li>
	<li>Add new Plugin API PLG_getHeaderCode, Used to return JS Functions or other Header Meta Tags required by the plugin. Added new variable {plg_headercode} to the template header.thtml files.</li>
	<li>New search: You can search for the exact phrase, all of the words, or any of the words from the query. Search words are highlighted in stories. Also, results in stories and comments are listed separately.</li>
	<li>Added new block "Privacy Options" to the Preferences:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>chose to receive email from admins and/or other users</li>
			<li>chose to show up in Who's Online block<br>
  (Feature requests #609758 and #609759)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>New config option $_CONF['hide_author_exclusion'] to hide the author exclusion list from the user's preferences (useful e.g. when it's a rather long list but hardly used by the users of your site).</li>
	<li>Added tracking of users lastlogin to the userinfo table. New $_CONF['lastlogin'] added to config.php - SESSION SETTINGS area</li>
	<li>Added an option in admin/group.php to list all the users belonging to a group.</li>
	<li>Added adminoption_off.thtml template file (for current entry in the Admin menu) and topicoption.thtml and topicoption_off.thtml files (for entries in the Topics/Sections menu).</li>
	<li>Geeklog will not accept topic ids containing spaces any more.</li>
	<li>Added new config option $_CONF['allow_account_delete'] to allow users to delete their account (from their Account Information page).</li>
	<li>Posts (stories and comments) from deleted users will now be reassigned to user "Anonymous".</li>
	<li>Removed the Geeklog version number from the footer of the default themes. Instead, the version number is now displayed in the headline of the "Command and Control" block (moderation.php) and next to the "GL Version Test" entry in the Admin's functions block.</li>
	<li>New Norwegian language file, provided by Torfinn Ingolfsen.</li>
	<li>Introduced new config.php variable $_CONF['mysqldump_options'] that holds additional options to be used when Geeklog calls mysqldump to do a backup of the database.</li>
	<li>Added a check for an existing email address in the user's profile so that users can't change their email address to one that's already in use for another account.</li>
	<li>Pick up the 'postmode' default setting for the Admin's story editor.</li>
	<li>Stories in the Daily Digest are now sorted by date (newest first, as on the index page).</li>
	<li>Changed handling of plugin comments slightly: Plugins will have to do the 'delete' operation on their comments on their own now since Geeklog can't possibly know which (if any) permissions are needed to delete a comment.<br>
  The 'id' parameter in the call to plugin_handlecomment_&lt;type&gt; will now always be the comment id.</li>
	<li>In another attempt to solve the various issues regarding "www vs. non-www" URLs and related login problems:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Made sure all setcookie() calls use all 6 parameters</li>
			<li>Try to guess the correct value for $_CONF['cookiedomain'] if it isn't set</li>
			<li>Removed the redirection attempt from index.php</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>When requesting a new password for your account, you can now enter either your username or the email address you used to register with the site.</li>
	<li>Added a speed limit for requests for a new password (defaults to 5 minutes between requests).</li>
	<li>The commentspeedlimit and submitspeedlimit tables have been replaced with a general speedlimit table and three new functions operating on it have been introduced (in lib-common.php). The new table has a 'type' field, so plugins could easily implement their own speed limits.</li>
	<li>Introduced new "forgot password" functionality: When requesting a new password for an account, the user will now receive an email with a link that s/he has to click on. It will take the user to a form where s/he can enter a new password (a unique id is contained in the URL and checked when entering the new password, thus preventing misuse). The old password remains valid until a new password is entered from this form, so the email can simply be ignored in case the user didn't request a new password (cf. Feature Request #567979).</li>
	<li>Removed unused commentheader.thtml file from all default themes.</li>
	<li>Fixed the redirect after posting a comment to a poll (should return to the poll, not to the index page).</li>
	<li>You can now "clone" events, i.e. make a copy of an existing event. This comes in handy if you have a lot of similar events (e.g. repeating events).<br>
  Template files admin/event/eventlist.thtml and admin/event/listitem.thtml need to be updated or the "clone" option will not show up ...</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the Admin's poll editor which let you enter more than $_CONF['maxanswers'] answers for a poll. You may need to adjust your setting of $_CONF['maxanswers'] or you may lose an answer when editing such a poll (found &amp; fixed by Tom Willet).</li>
	<li>Moved hard-coded HTML for the poll block and poll results to new template files.</li>
	<li>When the theme uses a replacement function for COM_siteHeader and/or COM_siteFooter, we need to pass it the same parameter that the replaced function was being called with.</li>
	<li>Fixed "Last 10 comments by user" in the user's profile which was missing the comments to polls.</li>
	<li>When a new user registers, we need to check for a valid email address first (before searching the database to see if that address is already in use)</li>
	<li>You are now taken back to the moderation page after editing a story submission</li>
	<li>Fixed 'previous' link on the Admin's list of stories. Alternatively, you can now use {google_paging} there (requires a change in the template).</li>
	<li>Added -Q option to the mysqldump call when doing a database backup. This will enclose database names in quotes and thus prevent problems with special characters in table names as used by some plugins (bug #712901).</li>
	<li>Set the max length of the input field for the event URL to 128 characters (was 96) in the default themes (other themes may need adjusting).</li>
	<li>Fixed localisation of the date of all-day events in the event details.</li>
	<li>Added missing {event_location} variable in calendar/eventdetails.thtml template files.</li>
	<li>Fixed display of events spanning several days in the personal calendar.</li>
	<li>Moved hard-coded HTML for the login form in the User Functions block to a new template file.</li>
	<li>The Sections block now uses the useroption.thtml and the new useroption_off.thtml template files for the list of topics. You can also use $_CONF['hide_home_link'] to hide the "Home" link from the Sections block.</li>
	<li>New config option $_CONF['keep_unscaled_image'] allows you to keep the original, unscaled image after upload (in stories only, for now). The smaller, scaled image will be used as a thumbnail and link to the original image (based on code provided by Alexander Schmacks).</li>
	<li>In admin/database.php:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Made sure we really display the last 10 backups (fix by Alexander Schmacks)</li>
			<li>Display total number of backups in the directory</li>
			<li>Moved hard-coded HTML for the list of backups to template files</li>
			<li>Replaced $PHP_SELF with $_CONF['site_admin_url']/database.php since $PHP_SELF seems to cause problems in some environments</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>You can now make one topic the default topic. The topic selection in the story submission form will then default to this topic.</li>
	<li>When clicking on the "contribute" link from the topic index page, the new story will now default to the topic you just viewed.<br>
  This only works with themes that use the {menu_elements} variable in header.thtml. Other themes can use the new variable {current_topic} which holds '&amp;topic=&lt;topicid&gt;' when a topic is selected (and is empty otherwise).</li>
	<li>Integrated Vincent Furia's improvements for COM_exportRDF. You can now use $_CONF['rdf_limit'] to limit the number of stories in the RDF file by setting this to a number (e.g. 10) or a number of hours (e.g. 24h).<br>
  $_CONF['rdf_storytext'] lets you add the story's introtext to the RDF feed. Also fixed a bug with un-escaped special characters in the feed's title.</li>
	<li>Added paging to the list of Static Pages (for more than 50 pages).</li>
	<li>Fixed problem with the Older Stories block disappearing when it was edited (e.g. moved from left to right), bug #670673.</li>
	<li>Fixed "late" update of portal blocks (bug #681855).</li>
	<li>Fixed mixing of comments from different plugins, found &amp; fixed by Alan McKay.</li>
	<li>A theme can provide its own functions to render the site header and footer (this is not a new feature). Geeklog now expects those functions to be named &lt;themename&gt;_siteHeader and &lt;themename&gt;_siteFoote, respectively. Until now, it was, however, looking for the wrong function names ...</li>
	<li>Added the piece of code that is needed to make the Theme Tester work to lib-common.php (won't do anything without the Theme Tester block).</li>
	<li>Fixed SQL query for displaying new comments in the What's New block, provided by Marc Von Ahn (with some help from Rob Griffiths).</li>
	<li>Changes to make Geeklog install and work again on old versions of MySQL (e.g. MySQL 3.22). Special thanks to Markus Guske for providing the fixes for the What's New block and for testing the new install.</li>
	<li>Feb 13/03: (Blaine) Added new Plugin function to support Center Blocks Included call to PLG_showCenterblock in index.php</li>
	<li>The user's signature is now appended to messages sent to another user.</li>
	<li>Feb 6/03: (Blaine)  Added support for custom user registration and account profile: Added hooks to users.php, usersettings.php and admin/user.php and new $_CONF parm to enable Developer is responsible for code to handle new form processing, account record save, update and delete.</li>
	<li>The list of blocks now includes a column indicating whether the block is enabled or disabled (will need changes in admin/block/listblocks.thtml and listitem.thtml template files of custom themes).</li>
	<li>Variable {rdf_url} (available in footer.thtml) holds the URL of the RDF file.</li>
	<li>What's Related block is now created dynamically.</li>
	<li>Top Ten Commented Stories didn't count comments on stories submitted by anonymous users (found &amp; fixed by Laurence Whitworth).</li>
	<li>Allow users to change their username if $_CONF['allow_username_change'] is set to 1.</li>
	<li>Jan 18/03: (Blaine) Corrected problem in mysql.class.php where the checks in dbdelete, dbchange, dbcount and dbcopy for a passed value of 0 were not sufficient. If the parameter was 0 - it was assuming it was empty.<br>
  Consequence: The dbdelete would delete all records or dbcount would return count(*)</li>
	<li>Display Preferences and Comment Preferences have been merged. There is now only one option, Preferences, in the User Functions block.</li>
	<li>Hard-coded HTML for the Display Preferences, Comment Preferences, and Account information has been moved to template files (new "preferences" directory).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Static Pages Plugin 1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Integrated (and extended) the Static Pages plugin 1.2 (originally started by Phill Gillespie and later supported by Tom Willet). This "combined" version is now called Static Pages 1.3.<br>
  Use Geeklog's install script to upgrade from any previous version (1.1 or 1.2)</li>
	<li>Supports the use of PHP in static pages.</li>
	<li>You can now edit the ID of a static page to create more readable URLs like http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=about<br>
	In combination with Geeklog's $_CONF['url_rewrite'] option, the URL can even look like http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/page/about</li>
	<li>You can now "clone" static pages, i.e. make a copy of an existing page.</li>
	<li>Removed the "static pages on frontpage" hack and changed the plugin to use the new Center Block API instead:<br>
  A static page can now be displayed on the top of the front page, on the bottom, or after the featured story. It can also replace the front page entirely. Instead of using special label names (like "frontpage"), the display mode and position can now be selected from drop-down menus in the static pages editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see docs/staticpages.html for details.</p>


<h2>January 26, 2004 (1.3.7sr5)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security issues:</p>
<ol>

	<li>It was possible to inject Javascript code in the calendar (reported by Jelmer).</li>
	<li>It was possible to execute (but not save) Javascript code in the comment preview (reported by Jelmer).</li>
</ol>


<h2>December 5, 2003 (1.3.7sr4)</h2>

<p>This release addresses the following security-related issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>As "dr.wh0" pointed out, the category field for link submissions was not filtered at all. Although you probably can't cause too much harm with those 32 characters, this has now been fixed.</li>
	<li>Vincent Furia found that the restrictions for the form to email users could be circumvented and could even be used to spam users.</li>
	<li>There was a way to post comments anonymously even when posting for anonymous users had been disabled.</li>
	<li>It was possible to post comments under someone else's username.</li>
</ol>


<h2>October 12, 2003 (1.3.7sr3)</h2>

<p>This release is intended to address some of the security issues reported in September and early October 2003.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Includes Ulf Harnhammar's kses HTML filter to address possible Javascript injections and CSS defacements.</li>
	<li>When upgrading from an earlier version, please make sure to copy over the $_CONF['user_html'] and $_CONF['admin_html'] arrays from the included config.php to your own copy of that file.</li>
	<li>While almost all of the alleged SQL injection issues could not be reproduced, this release includes an update to the MySQL class to not report SQL errors in the browser any more (but only in Geeklog's error.log).<br>
   This will avoid disclosing any sensitive information as part of the error message.<br>

   Please note that at the moment we do NOT recommend to use Geeklog with MySQL 4.1 (which, at the time of this writing, is in alpha state and should not be used on production sites anyway).<br>

   An upcoming release of Geeklog will address the remaining SQL issues, including any problems with MySQL 4.1.</li>
</ol>


<h2>May 26, 2003 (1.3.7sr2)</h2>

<p>Security issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It was possible to obtain valid session ids for every account (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
	<li>Using Internet Explorer, it was possible to upload an image with embedded PHP code and execute it (reported by SCAN Associates).</li>
	<li>Story permissions could override topic permissions, resulting in the display of stories to users who shouldn't have access to them (reported by Andrew Lawlor).<br>
   Note: This was already fixed with the new index.php, released 2003-05-15.</li>
	<li>Added a warning in config.php that adding any of the following tags to the list of allowable HTML can make the site vulnerable to scripting attacks:<br>
   &lt;img&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;marquee&gt; &lt;script&gt; &lt;embed&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;iframe&gt;<br>
   (pointed out by Joat Dede)</li>
	<li>Fixed the bug in several of the admin areas (blocks, events, links, polls, stories, topics) where admins without root access got a message stating that they did not have the proper permissions when trying to save an object.</li>
	<li>Fixed a typo in lib-sessions.php that caused the creation of unnecessary sessions (pointed out by Kobaz).</li>
	<li>Fixed malformed cookie (used $_CONF['site_url'] instead of $_CONF['cookiedomain']) in lib-sessions.php, found &amp; fixed by Jon Evans.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented certain right blocks from showing up when there were no stories for a topic.</li>
	<li>The "Google paging" on the index page may have displayed the wrong number of pages for users who disabled topics in their display preferences.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by Claudio.</li>

	<li>New Czech language file, provided by Hermes Trismegistos</li>
</ul>


<h2>January 13, 2003 (1.3.7sr1)</h2>

<p>Security issues:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Javascript code could be used in the homepage link of a user's profile (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
	<li>Javascript code could be injected in several URLs so that these could then be used for a cross-site scripting attack (reported by Jin Yean Tan).</li>
	<li>Anybody could delete comments, provided they knew the comment id.</li>
	<li>A StoryAdmin could manipulate any story, even if permissions should have prevented that. The same applied to Admins for links, events, polls, topics, and blocks (reported by Kobaz).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>The new user notification email was always sent out, even if 'user' was not listed in $_CONF['notification'].</li>
	<li>In admin/database.php, added a check to test if function is_executable() is available (since it is not available on Windows).</li>
	<li>{copyright_notice} in the site's footer (footer.thtml) will now use the current year for the copyright notice. You can override this by setting $_CONF['copyrightyear'] to the year you want.<br>
  Also, new variables {lang_copyright} and {current_year} as well as {site_name} and {site_slogan} are now available in footer.thtml so that you can build a customised copyright notice from them.</li>
	<li>Fixed incomplete links to search results from poll comments.</li>
	<li>Fixed wrong link to the week view from the last week of the month view.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where links was not using the date field - being stored as null.</li>
	<li>Fixed image resizing when using ImageMagick.</li>
	<li>Added the actual and max. image dimensions in the error message that is displayed when an image exceeds the max. image dimensions and no imagelib is configured.</li>
	<li>The Admin menu will now be displayed for users which have Admin access to a plugin but not to a core Geeklog Admin feature.</li>
	<li>The redirect in index.php (when a site is called up with a URL other than the one configured in $_CONF['site_url']) now checks for the existence of $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_HOST']. Also, the server name comparison is done case-insensitive now.</li>
	<li>New config option $_CONF['emailstoriesperdefault']: Set to 1 if new users should be subscribed to the daily digest automatically. Defaults to 0 (no automatic subscribtion), thus restoring the behaviour of Geeklog prior to 1.3.7.</li>
	<li>Removed some unused / outdated files (include and etc directories)</li>
	<li>Updated URLs to point to www.geeklog.net and lists.geeklog.net instead of the now outdated places on Sourceforge.</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by R.F. van der Veen</li>
	<li>New Danish language files (for Geeklog and for the Static Pages plugin), provided by Steen Broelling</li>
</ul>


<h2>December 16, 2002 (1.3.7)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In all Admin editors, the hard-coded default group permissions have been changed from 3 (read/write) to 2 (read-only).</li>
	<li>Make sure an error message is displayed when a StoryAdmin tries to edit a story s/he does not have access to.</li>
	<li>Hide topics from the Admin's list of stories that the current (Story)Admin has no access to.</li>
	<li>Tom Willet found a problem in admin/user.php that sometimes mangled user names, especially on sites hosted on sourceforge.net.</li>
	<li>Fixed an SQL error when using single quotes in a block title.</li>
	<li>When updating events in the master calendar, make sure copies of such events in the personal calendars are updated as well (including deleting them when the original event is removed from the master calendar).</li>
	<li>Fixed PRIMARY KEY for table personal_events, so that more than one user can add an event to his/her personal calendar.</li>
	<li>New Hellenic (Greek) language file, provided by Access-=-Denied Networks</li>
	<li>New Spanish language file, provided by LeChuck</li>
	<li>Updated Polish language file, provided by Robert Stadnik</li>
	<li>Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65</li>
	<li>Updated Japanese language file, provided by Yusuke Sakata</li>
</ul>


<h2>December 3, 2002 (1.3.7rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Modifed savesubmission() to better handle Plugin return - Bug ID 642106</li>
	<li>Modified Comment Plugin API Comment call - PLG_handlePluginComment now passes $operation to indicate a 'save' or 'delete'.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with the portal.php redirect for links (bug #579221).</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem when uploading images with certain versions of Opera.</li>
	<li>When deleting a topic, also remove stories for that topic from the submission queue.</li>
	<li>Added a redirect in index.php when the site was called up with the "wrong" URL (i.e. not the one that has been set in $_CONF['site_url']), thus fixing the "www vs. non-www" problem where people showed up in Who's Online but did not get the User Functions block.</li>
	<li>The topic selection in the daily digest now defaults to "on" for all topics, i.e. when the daily digest is activated ($_CONF['emailstories'] = 1) and a user has not selected any topics yet, s/he will receive a digest for all topics. This ensures that new topics are automatically added to the daily digest (bug #573305).</li>
	<li>Fixed a permission problem with the daily digest where users could get a digested version of a story they didn't have access to.</li>
	<li>Fixed permission problems in the statistics where story titles, links, and events where listed even when the current user did not have access to them.</li>
	<li>Added the Top Ten Links to the links page (only when links are displayed per category).</li>
	<li>When sending emails, Geeklog now uses \r\n in the mail headers which should resolve problems under Windows.</li>
	<li>Resolved a couple of stripslashes() issues.</li>
	<li>The static pages plugin can now be uninstalled using the "delete" option from the plugin editor. Note that this will only remove the plugin's tables and data from the database, not remove any files.</li>
	<li>Added a simple email notification when a new story, link, or event has been submitted or a new user has registered. See $_CONF['notification'] for details</li>
	<li>Added a separate set of config variables for the max. dimensions of user photos ($_CONF['max_photo_width'] etc.).</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem when resizing GIF images using the netpbm tools.</li>
	<li>Check the topic permissions when presenting a list of topics in the Admin story editor (since the StoryAdmin may not have access to all topics).</li>
	<li>Removed the Normal / Archive / Refreshing drop down menus from the admin story and poll editors since they're not used anyway.</li>
	<li>In the links section, do not display link categories when the current user does not have access to the links in those categories (bug #612869).</li>
	<li>Fixed problems when using quotes in the title of an HTML-formatted comment (including confusing error messages and wrong speed limit alerts).</li>
	<li>Changed the way how Geeklog checks if it's currently displaying the site's front page, thus fixing the problem with disappearing "homeonly" blocks.</li>
	<li>Fixed double line spacing in HTML-formatted comments and [code] sections when running on PHP 4.2.0 and up.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with slashes and HTML entities in emails sent out by Geeklog (Send story to friend, daily digest, Admin mail utility).</li>
	<li>Added new config variable 'showfirstasfeatured' which, when set to 1, will render the first story on _any_ page like it was a featured story.</li>
	<li>Added admin/plugins/newpluginlist.thtml and newlistitem.thml template files for the list of plugins not installed yet. These files are optional, i.e. the list will be formatted using hard-coded HTML when they don't exist.</li>
	<li>Removed unused template file admin/plugins/installform.thtml.</li>
	<li>The plugin menu will now list all plugins which exist in the file system but haven't been installed (yet) with a link to their install script for easy installation (based on code provided by Blaine Lang).</li>
	<li>New plugin API function PLG_callCommentForm() and improvements for the use of comments in plugins, provided by Blaine Lang.</li>
	<li>The Older Stories block did not take stories into account which were to be published in the future. Therefore, the block sometimes listed stories that were still on the first index page.</li>
	<li>Added variable {contributedby_photo} (user photo of story author) for use in story templates.</li>
	<li>Users couldn't disable display of the Older Stories block in their preferences</li>
	<li>The contents of the Older Stories block was deleted whenever you changed it (e.g. moving it from the left to the right column).</li>
	<li>The static pages editor displayed a blank page when the title and/or content field of a new static page were not filled in (will display an error message now).</li>
	<li>Implemented fixes for plugins using the submission queue, suggested by Vincent Furia.</li>
	<li>Following the link "X stories in last 24 hours" from the What's New block will now display only the new stories on the index page.</li>
	<li>When $_CONF['searchloginrequired'] = 2, the search is completely blocked for anonymous users (1 will only block the advanced search).</li>
	<li>Added a check to test for a valid date format when searching by date.</li>
	<li>Added $_CONF['skip_preview'] to allow submission of comments and stories without previewing (defaults to off).</li>
	<li>Search queries with less than 3 characters are now rejected to reduce server load.</li>
	<li>(Event)Admins couldn't add events directly to their personal calendar (found &amp; fixed by Kenn Osborne).</li>
	<li>Fixed a nasty bug in SEC_inGroup() (in lib-security.php) that let a user admin change the password of a root user, so that effectively every user admin could become a root user ...</li>
	<li>Topics are now sorted alphabetically by the topic name instead of by topic id.</li>
	<li>Added several new variables which can be used in the story template files.</li>
	<li>New config options $_CONF['dateonly'] and $_CONF['timeonly'] which hold the format string for day + month (to be used in the Upcoming Events and Older Stories blocks) and the time (to be used for event details).</li>
	<li>Fixed calls to unknown function printErrorMsgs in the file upload class.</li>
	<li>New options in config.php:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>$_CONF['upcomingeventsrange'] = no. of days to look ahead for upcoming events</li>
			<li>$_CONF['emailstoryloginrequired'] = disallow "send story be email" for anonymous users</li>
			<li>$_CONF['hideemailicon'], $_CONF['hideprintericon'] = hide email / printer icon from stories (and from Story Options block)</li>
			<li>$_CONF['hidenewstories'], $_CONF['hidenewcomments'], $_CONF['hidenewlinks'] = hide new stories / comments / links from What's New block</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>User photos are now resized according to the image dimensions in config.php (if an imagelib is configured - otherwise images exceeding those dimensions are rejected).</li>
	<li>Added a check for the proper permissions on the admin page of the Static Pages plugin.</li>
	<li>Plugins can now return "false" (or an empty array) from plugin_cclabel_&lt;plugin-name&gt; so that the plugin's icon does not show up in moderation.php if the user does not have the proper access rights for the plugin. Changed the Static Pages plugin to do exactly that.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems when using multiple [code] ... [/code] sections.</li>
	<li>PHP blocks which return an empty string are not displayed any more. This allows PHP blocks to "hide" themselves.</li>
	<li>Searching for links caused an SQL error on installs that were upgraded from Geeklog 1.1 (missing "date" field in links table). However, links don't use that field anyway, so searching by date was removed (the "date" field will be added when upgrading the database to 1.3.7).<br>
  Also, the search results are now sorted by link title.</li>
	<li>The calendar displayed an empty last week (in month view) for some months, e.g. November 2002.</li>
	<li>COM_pollResults() will not use the side block templates when called from pollbooth.php (thus allowing different block layouts for the poll results in a side block and in pollbooth.php).</li>
	<li>Allow for theme-based topic icons by using the $_THEME_URL variable as the base directory for topic icons (if that variable is set).</li>
	<li>Fixed display (or lack thereof) of $ signs in portal blocks.</li>
	<li>lib-common.php didn't use $_CONF['path_language'] to include the default language file.</li>
	<li>What's Related block<br>
		<ul>
			<li>content is now set for all user submitted stories (previously, links where only added in stories submitted by the Admin or user submissions edited by the Admin)</li>
			<li>block is not displayed when it's empty</li>
			<li>now uses COM_makeList() (i.e. the list.thtml and listitem.thtml template files) instead of hard-coded &lt;li&gt;tags</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The What's Related and Story Options blocks can now be used independent of each other in the article/article.thtml template file - use {whats_related}, {story_options} or {whats_related_story_options}.</li>
	<li>Theme authors can now use the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE "hack" for the What's Related and Story Options blocks as well (using 'whats_related_block' and 'story_options_block' as the block names).</li>
	<li>Fixed the "noboxes" feature where all blocks (with the exception of the section, login / user functions, and admin blocks) are hidden.</li>
	<li>Changed admin/link/listitem.thtml so that the URLs in the Admin's list of links are clickable.</li>
	<li>Fixed an SQL error when calling search.php and there were no stories and no comments in the system.</li>
	<li>Fixed an SQL error in the user profile when there were no stories and no polls in the system.</li>
	<li>Fixed date bug when previewing stories to be posted around the noon hour in the admin story editor.</li>
	<li>Added sanity checks in admin/story.php to prevent possible loss of stories when using an incomplete language file (or manipulating the URL).</li>
	<li>Fixed a variable in admin/plugins/editor.ththml of the Smooth Blue theme.</li>
	<li>Fixed a typo and a grammatical error in english.php</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with the "static page as frontpage" hack:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>will now check if the static pages plugin is installed and enabled</li>
			<li>uses sp_format (i.e. display blocks as specified in the static pages editor)</li>
			<li>added a missing stripslashes() call</li>
		</ul><br>
  New: When you have $_SP_CONF['in_block'] == 1 and the label of the static page is neither empty nor "nonews" then that label is used as the block title for the static page.</li>
	<li>The "userevent" table is back in lib-database.php. Geeklog doesn't use this table any more, but the name is needed when upgrading from old versions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Localisation:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New Chinese language file (Big 5 encoding), provided by Jacky Chan</li>
	<li>New Swedish language file, provided by Markus Berg</li>
	<li>Updated Dutch language file, provided by R. F. van der Veen</li>
	<li>Updated French language file, provided by Florent Guiliani</li>
	<li>The German language file now uses the proper national special characters (umlauts) instead of HTML entities.</li>
	<li>New Polish language file for the Static Pages plugin, provided by Robert Stadnik</li>
	<li>New Spanish language file for the Static Pages Plugin, provided by gorka</li>
</ul>


<h2>September 20, 2002 (1.3.6)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Images in stories can now be resized automatically during upload, provided you have either ImageMagick or netpbm installed. See the image settings in config.php for details.</li>
	<li>If you create a static page with the title "Frontpage" then the content of this static page will be displayed above the first story on the front page of your site. If you additionally set the label of this static page to "nonews", then the static page will completeley replace the news on the front page of your site. You may want to wrap static pages in a block - set $_SP_CONF['in_block'] = 1;<br>
  in /path/to/geeklog/plugins/staticpages/config.php</li>
	<li>A user assigned only to the Mail Admin group wasn't able to use the "Mail Users" function.</li>
	<li>The filter to disable Javascript onXXX events also changed certain links in HTML postings. This should be fixed now.</li>
	<li>The poll uses a POST instead of a GET request now to at least prevent primitive manipulation attempts ...</li>
	<li>Events on the same day were displayed in the order they were entered, not in the order they were scheduled (occured in day, week, and month view).</li>
	<li>The user function and admin blocks weren't using the proper templates when the theme was using the $_BLOCK_TEMPLATE trick, as outlined in <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php?story=20020429092841722">http://www.geeklog.net/article.php?story=20020429092841722</a>.</li>
	<li>When the first character of the content of a block is a '&lt;' it is now assumed that the block contains HTML and nl2br() is not applied to the block content. This allows proper HTML usage and even the use of Javascript in blocks.</li>
	<li>Sanity checks have been added to the admin editors (including the editor for static pages) to prevent possible damage to the database in case of incomplete translations (language files) or invalid IDs.</li>
	<li>The delete button in the plugin editor, which was unused since the removal of the automated plugin install (in Geeklog 1.3.4), will now cause a function plugin_uninstall_&lt;plugin name&gt; to be called. This allows plugins to uninstall themselves (if possible).</li>
	<li>The author's name was missing from emailed stories. Also changed it so that the author's name is only included when $_CONF['contributedbyline'] == 1.<br>
  The daily digest now also includes the author's name.</li>
	<li>Fixed the "1054: Unknown column 'deleted' in 'where clause'" SQL error that some people were getting when logging out.</li>
	<li>Submitted stories will now pick up the permissions from the topic they were posted under (instead of using default permissions).</li>
	<li>Added new features story.submit, link.submit, event.submit which, when assigned to a group, allow members of that group to post directly (skipping the submission queue) even when the submissione queue is active.</li>
	<li>Fixed issues with backslashes in block titles, as suggested by Neil Darlow.</li>
	<li>The page navigation is now wrapped in a &lt;div class="pagenav"&gt; so that it can be formatted by a theme using CSS.<br>
  Because of this change, the template files admin/user/userslist.thtml and links/links.thtml had to be changed, because they wrapped the page navigation in a &lt;p&gt;.</li>
	<li>Submission of links and events by anonymous users failed when the link submission queues were switched off.</li>
	<li>Anonymous users were able to submit comments even when $_CONF['loginrequired'] was set to 1.</li>
	<li>Fixed a search bug introduced in 1.3.6rc1 when searching by author.</li>
	<li>When updating from an earlier version, the install script will no longer try to rename the staticpage table when no prefix is used in the database.</li>
	<li>PLG_getUserOptions() will no longer return empty menu options.</li>
	<li>Updated Italian language file, provided by quess65</li>
	<li>Changed some wording in the German language file</li>
	<li>Fixed spelling errors in the English language file</li>
</ul>


<h2>August 28, 2002 (1.3.6rc1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Problems with using the dollar sign in stories, comments, and their titles have been fixed.</li>
	<li>Fresh installations now have a "Are you secure?" block pre-installed that only the Admin can see and which does some (very simple) tests whether the site is secure or not.</li>
	<li>Fixed the page navigation in (admin's) user list.</li>
	<li>Using the preview in the admin story editor will now keep the topic icon and the time will not revert from pm to am any more.</li>
	<li>The links section now includes a list of the link categories at the top. The list of links is now also separated into pages (10 links per page by default, configurable in config.php).<br>
  To get back the old (pre-1.3.6) style of the links section, just set both $_CONF['linkcols'] and $_CONF['linksperpage'] (in config.php) to 0. These changes are based on code provided by Tom Willett.</li>
	<li>Fixed the SQL syntax for some requests ("count(*) AS count" instead of "count(*) count") which seems to have caused problems with some (older) versions of MySQL.</li>
	<li>A proper error message is now displayed when attempting to use "Mail Users" but not filling out all the fields.</li>
	<li>Editing a portal block shouldn't make it disappear any more ...</li>
	<li>The somewhat random order of poll answers has been fixed.</li>
	<li>The site can be disabled by setting $_CONF['site_enabled'] = false; in config.php. $_CONF['site_disabled_msg'] can either contain a message to be displayed in that case or a URL (has to start with http:) to which all requests will be redirected.</li>
	<li>Fixed various access rights / privacy issues where users could see (but not access) information even when they shouldn't ...<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Search returns only those stories, comments, links, and events to which the user has the proper access rights</li>
			<li>What's New block counts stories and comments according to access rights now (this should also fix the problems some people had when New Comments were not displayed for anonymous users). New Links also take access rights into account.</li>
			<li>Upcoming events are only visible to those with the proper rights.</li>
			<li>Topics are not available for submissions without proper rights.</li>
			<li>Topic selection in the user preferences also follows access rights.</li>
			<li>"Last 10 comments" (and the new "Last 10 stories too, of course) in profile takes proper rights into account</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Story display and paged navigation weren't working properly when some stories were only accessible to certain users.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where users weren't able to use the site when their theme had been removed (until they cleared their cookies).</li>
	<li>New installations now have only two default accounts: The Admin account (as before) and a Moderator account that has access to the story, links, and events submission queues.</li>
	<li>The Older Stories block should work again.</li>
	<li>The submission queues for stories, links, events, and users can now be switched off separately (in config.php), i.e. items submitted by users will then be visible to everybody immediately.</li>
	<li>The database backup is more verbose now, especially when there are problems (changes provided by Blaine Lang).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the admin's user photo overwrote a user's photo when the admin was editing the user's account information.</li>
	<li>Group editor:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Could not create new groups when using a non-english language file.</li>
			<li>Once you've added one group to another (by checking off an option from the "Security Groups" list), there was no way to uncheck it again.</li>
			<li>The message after saving/deleting a group said that the topic(!) had been saved/deleted ...</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Changes in search:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Should be faster now.</li>
			<li>Search by date did not work (mostly because the date format recommended to be used in a search is really YYYY-MM-DD and not MM-DD-YYYY).</li>
			<li>List of authors is now sorted by username.</li>
			<li>Search results for links are now routed via portal.php, too, so that the links are counted when clicked.</li>
			<li>When no results are returned for a search, then the search form will now be displayed below that message again.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The static pages plugin uses the table prefix now (databases created with Geeklog 1.3.5 or older need to be upgraded).</li>
	<li>A user submission queue has been added. When activated in config.php ($_CONF['usersubmission'] = 1;), new users will not get their password emailed until they are approved by an admin.<br>
  You can, however, let users from certain domains be approved automatically by adding their domain names to the comma-separated list of domains in $_CONF['allow_domains'].</li>
	<li>Fixed problems with quotes in poll question and answers.</li>
	<li>The default value for the number of stories per page for a new user is now taken from $_CONF['limitnews'] (was hard-coded to 10).</li>
	<li>The user profile has been extended to include<br>
		<ul>
			<li>last 10 stories by that user</li>
			<li>total number of stories and comments posted by that user</li>

			<li>check.php will check the file and directory permissions</li>
			<li>configinfo.php will display the contents of config.php</li>

	<li>Disable all onXXX Javascript events in HTML postings (stories and comments).</li>
	<li>Fill in user name and email address when writing an email to a user (via the 'send email' form from the user profile).</li>

</ul>


<h2>June 10, 2002 (1.3.5sr1)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This release addresses security issues recently discovered by the people at olympos.org. These issues allow for the injection of malicious javascript code (which could be used to access the admin's cookie) and the injection of MySQL code which could be used to access and even damaged the database (under certain circumstances). Details will be available in a report on the Bugtraq list shortly after this release is out.</li>

	<li>Fixed problems with saving rights to a group in admin/group.php (admin/group.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in admin/user that would reset user's settings when admin made a change (admin/user.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in index.php.  There were two FOR loops, one nested inside the other both interating on the variable $i.  This caused problems only for users who went into display preferences and selected only the topics they wanted to get articles for (index.php)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in story admin that would prevent the date edit from prepopulating right when admin hit the preview button (admin/story.php)</li>
	<li>Modified admin/plugin.php to reflect change in how plugins are installed.  Because of platform dependance issues, all plugins will have a simple but manual installation process.  This should work across all platforms. (admin/plugin.php, layout/Yahoo/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Classic/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml, layout/Digital_Monochrome/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml)</li>
	<li>Alter the database to force all stories to show on the frontpage by default.  This will make the moderation of articles work as expected.  Before if you approved an article it would show up only in the topic and not on the frontpage (mysql_tableanddata.sql, table.sql, mysql_1.3.3_to_1.3.4.sql)</li>
</ul>


<h2>March 1, 2002</h2>
<ul>

	<li>Rudimentary support for database backups (one per day at most).  There is no restore capability at this time.</li>
	<li>Modified the display preference so we store the blocks a user doesn't want to see instead of the ones they do want to see.  This will allow any new block to show up by default as expected.</li>
	<li>Removed hardcoded english from COM_emailUserTopics</li>
	<li>Fixed minor security bug with whats new block. It would display items the user didn't have access too (however, if they click them they would correctly get the access denied message)</li>

	<li>Topic administration now save anonymous permissions properly</li>

  Hey, if I can save 2k per hit, thats a big deal! :-)</li>

However, all the code I am writing here will be published in the hopes that Jason and others may find these functions useful.  If you looking for a weblog software that is cool, configurable and supported by someone I would recommend you check out http://phpweblog.org and party on dudes!</li>
