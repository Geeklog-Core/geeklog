List of Known Bugs:

1) You can't post an article with a future publish date as featured AND have a visible
   featured article up until that time.
2) the installation script does no form validation...should probably change ;-)
3) seems as though plugins don't work under windows.  This isn't intentional and will be fixed
4) documents need updating before stable 1.4 release
