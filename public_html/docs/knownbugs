List of Known Bugs:

1) the emailgeeklogstories functionality isn't working.  This will be addressed in the next release
2) the installation script does no form validation...should probably change ;-)
3) seems as though plugins don't work under windows.  This isn't intentional and will be fixed
4) documents need updating before stable 1.4 release
