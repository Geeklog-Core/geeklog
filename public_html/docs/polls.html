<h1>Polls Plugin</h1>

<p>Polls used to be an integral part of the Geeklog core code, but have been
moved to a plugin as of Geeklog 1.4.0.</p>

<h2><a name="config.php">Configuration File</a></h2>

<p>The polls plugin has its own configuration file, located at <tt>/path/to/geeklog/plugins/polls/config.php</tt>. There you will find the following options:</p>

<table>
<tr><th width="25%">Variable</th>
    <th width="25%">Default Value</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_pollsloginrequired">pollsloginrequired</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>When set to 1, only registered users can access the list of recent
    polls.<br>
    Please note that <code>$_CONF['<a
    href="config.html#desc_loginrequired">loginrequired</a>']</code> in
    <tt>config.php</tt> takes precedence over this setting. So when
    <code>'loginrequired'</code> is set to 1, anonymous users can not access
    the recent polls even when <code>'pollsloginrequired'</code> is set
    to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_hidepollsmenu">hidepollsmenu</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether to hide the "Polls" entry from Geeklog's menu bar (when set to 1)
    or to show it (when set to 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_maxanswers">maxanswers</a></td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>Maximum number of possible answers for the poll editor.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_answerorder">answerorder</a></td>
  <td>submitorder</td>
  <td>Sort answers by the number of results ('voteorder') or keep the order
    in which they were entered ('submitorder').</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_pollcookietime">pollcookietime</a></td>
  <td>86400</td>
  <td>Number of seconds to set a poll answer cookie to time out on.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_polladdresstime">polladdresstime</a></td>
  <td>604800</td>
  <td>Number of seconds to set a poll answer IP address to time out on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_delete_polls">delete_polls</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Defines what to do when a user is deleted that is the owner of a poll.
    When set to 0, all polls owned by the deleted user will be assigned to a
    user of the "Root" group (e.g. the site admin). When set to 1, the polls
    are deleted, including all the comments posted on that poll.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>How do the polls work?</h2>

<p><small>(Taken from the <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/faqman/">Geeklog
FAQ</a>)</small></p>

<p>In order to prevent manipulation of polls (or at least make it harder),
Geeklog does two things when you vote:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It stores a cookie</li>
  <li>It stores your IP address</li>
</ol>

<p>Both the cookie and the IP are valid for a certain amount of time (see below)
and during that time, you can't vote again on the same poll.</p>

<p>The amount of time your cookie and IP are stored can be changed in the polls
plugin's <tt>config.php</tt>:</p>

<pre>$_PO_CONF['pollcookietime']    = 86400;
$_PO_CONF['polladdresstime']   = 604800;</pre>

<p>Both times are in seconds, i.e. the cookie is valid for 24 hours and the IP
is stored for a week.</p>

<p>In setups where more than one person uses the same computer or the same IP
address, you can set one (or both) of them to 1.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that <strong>any</strong> poll can be manipulated, so
you shouldn't take the results too seriously.</p>
