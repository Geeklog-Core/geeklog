<h1>Links Plugin</h1>

<p>The links section used to be an integral part of the Geeklog core code, but have been moved to a plugin as of Geeklog 1.4.0.</p>

<h2><a name="config.php">Configuration File</a></h2>

<p>The links plugin has its own configuration file, located at <tt>/path/to/geeklog/plugins/links/config.php</tt>. There you will find the following options:</p>

<table>
<tr><th width="25%">Variable</th>
    <th width="25%">Default Value</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_delete_links">delete_links</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Defines what to do when a user is deleted that is the owner of a link.
    When set to 0, all links owned by the deleted user will be assigned to a
    user of the "Root" group (e.g. the site admin). When set to 1, the links
    are deleted.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_hidelinksmenu">hidelinksmenu</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether to hide the "Links" entry from Geeklog's menu bar (when set to 1)
    or to show it (when set to 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_hidenewlinks">hidenewlinks</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether new links should be hidden from the "What's New" block (when set
    = 1) or whether to list them there (when set to = 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_linkcols">linkcols</a></td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>The number of link categories to display per column.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_linksloginrequired">linksloginrequired</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>When set to 1, only registered users can access the links section.<br>
    Please note that <code>$_CONF['<a
    href="config.html#desc_loginrequired">loginrequired</a>']</code> in
    <tt>config.php</tt> takes precedence over this setting. So when
    <code>'loginrequired'</code> is set to 1, anonymous users can not access
    the links section even when <code>'linksloginrequired'</code> is set
    to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_linksperpage">linksperpage</a></td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>The number of links to show per page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_linksubmission">linksubmission</a></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Whether links submitted by users will have to be approved by an admin
    first (when set = 1) or show up immediately (when set = 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_newlinksinterval">newlinksinterval</a></td>
  <td>1209600</td>
  <td>For how long a link should be considered "new" and show up in the "What's
    New" block on the site. The interval is given in seconds, so the default
    value equals 14 days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_notification">notification</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether to send an email notification when a new link was submitted (when
    set to = 1) or not (when set to = 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_show_top10">show_top10</a></td>
  <td><code>true</code></td>
  <td>When both <code>$_LI_CONF['linkcols']</code> and
    <code>$_LI_CONF['linksperpage']</code> are <em>not</em> 0, the plugin will
    show a list of the 10 most clicked-on links on the Links plugin's index
    page automatically. If you do not want that "top 10" list there, set this
    option to <code>false</code>.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2><a name="layout">Layout of the Links plugin's index page</a></h2>

<p>The general layout of the index page of the Links plugin is defined by the
options <code>$_LI_CONF['linkcols']</code> and <code>$_LI_CONF['linksperpage']</code>, as explained above.</p>

<p>If you'd rather have a straight list of all your links, you can set both
of these options to 0. This probably makes the most sense when you only have
a few links. Setting only <code>$_LI_CONF['linksperpage']</code> to 0 zero will
list all the links of the current category on one page. Setting only
<code>$_LI_CONF['linkcols']</code> to 0 will hide the categories and will
display all your links spread over several pages.</p>


<h3><a name="templates">Template files</a></h3>

<p>To further change the layout of your Links section, you can change the
template files. Please note that they are now located in the plugin's directory,
i.e. in</p>
<p align="center"><tt>/path/to/geeklog/plugins/links/templates/</tt></p>
<p>If you're using a theme that was made for an older version of Geeklog (prior
to Geeklog 1.4.0), you may still have a "links" directory in your theme's
directory - but that is not used any more and can be safely removed.</p>
