<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Geeklog was originally developed for the Security Geeks web site and was
originally authored by Jason Whittenburg.  In early 2001, Jason decided it
was time to devote his time to other things and handed the project over to
Tony Bibbs who uses Geeklog to run <a href="http://www.iowaoutdoors.org/">Iowa
Outdoors</a>. Tony is currently focusing on getting the next generation
Geeklog, dubbed GL2, off the ground, while Dirk Haun is now maintaining the
1.x branch.</p>

<p>Geeklog is bona fide open-source software and has been released under the
<a href="license" title="GNU General Public License">GNU GPL</a> for use by
others. Configuring Geeklog is meant to be an easy process though it will
require you to have access to several components of your system.</p>

<p>This document is still evolving, so there may be unintended omissions or
various steps may be over or under explained. It's assumed  that you have
some working experience with some form of <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> (or IIS), SQL databases (such as
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>), and <a
href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.</p>
