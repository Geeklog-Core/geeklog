<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>GeekLog was originally developed for the Security Geeks web site and was 
originally authored by Jason Whittenburg.  In early 2001, Jason decided it 
was time to devote his time to other things and the project has since been 
maintained by Tony Bibbs who uses Geeklog to run <a 
href="http://www.iowaoutdoors.org/">Iowa Outdoors</a>. Geeklog is bona fide 
open-source software and has been released under the <a href="license" 
title="GNU General Public License">GNU GPL</a> for use by others. 
Configuring GeekLog is meant to be an easy process though it will require 
you to have access to several components of your system.</p>

<p>This document is still evolving, so there may be unintended omissions or 
various steps may be over or under explained. It's assumed  that you have 
some working experience with some form of <a 
href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> (or IIS), SQL databases (such as 
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>), and <a 
href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.</p>
