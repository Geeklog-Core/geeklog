<h1>Calendar Plugin</h1>

<p>Events and the calendar used to be an integral part of the Geeklog core code,
but have been moved to a plugin as of Geeklog 1.4.1.</p>

<h2><a name="config.php">Configuration File</a></h2>

<p>The calendar plugin has its own configuration file, located at <tt>/path/to/geeklog/plugins/calendar/config.php</tt>. There you will find the following options:</p>

<table>
<tr><th width="25%">Variable</th>
    <th width="25%">Default Value</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_calendarloginrequired">calendarloginrequired</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>When set to 1, only registered users can access the calendar<br>
    Please note that <code>$_CONF['<a
    href="config.html#desc_loginrequired">loginrequired</a>']</code> in
    <tt>config.php</tt> takes precedence over this setting. So when
    <code>'loginrequired'</code> is set to 1, anonymous users can not access
    the calendar even when <code>'calendarloginrequired'</code> is set
    to 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_delete_event">delete_event</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Defines what to do when a user is deleted that is the owner of an event.
    When set to 0, all events owned by the deleted user will be assigned to a
    user of the "Root" group (e.g. the site admin). When set to 1, the events
    are deleted. This only applies to site events - a user's personal events
    are always deleted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_eventsubmission">eventsubmission</a></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Whether events submitted by users will have to be approved by an admin
    first (when set = 1) or show up immediately (when set = 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_event_types">event_types</a></td>
  <td>Anniversary, Appointment, Birthday, Business, Education, Holiday, Meeting, Miscellaneous, Personal, Phone Call, Special Occasion, Travel, Vacation</td>
  <td>The set of event types that are used both on the public calendar and the
    user's personal calendar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_hidecalendarmenu">hidecalendarmenu</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether to hide the "Calendar" entry from Geeklog's menu bar (when set to
    1) or to show it (when set to 0).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_hour_mode">hour_mode</a></td>
  <td>12</td>
  <td>Which format to use when submitting or editing an event. Can be 12 (for
    the 12 hours am/pm format) or 24 (for the 24 hours format).<br>
    Uses the same value as <a
    href="config.html#desc_hour_mode">$_CONF['hour_mode']</a> by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_notification">notification</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Whether to send an email notification when a new event was submitted for
    the site's calendar (when set to = 1) or not (when set to = 0).<br>
    No notification is ever sent for events in personal calendars.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_personalcalendars">personalcalendars</a></td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Allow account holders to have a personal calendar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a name="desc_showupcomingevents">showupcomingevents</a></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Whether to show upcoming events (0 = no, 1 = yes) in a separate
    block.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r2">
  <td><a name="desc_upcomingeventsrange">upcomingeventsrange</a></td>
  <td>14</td>
  <td>Number of days that the &quot;Upcoming Events&quot; block will look
    ahead.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2><a name="others">Other Options</a></h2>

<p>Please note that some of the options from Geeklog's main <tt>config.php</tt>
are also relevant for the calendar plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Times and dates are formatted according to the current language and the
    <a href="config.html#locale">locale settings</a> from Geeklog's main
    <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
<li>The names of the <a name="states">states</a> that are listed in a drop-down
    box when submitting an event are taken from the <code>$_STATES</code> array
    at the end of Geeklog's main <tt>config.php</tt>.</li>
</ul>
