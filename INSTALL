Quick and Dirty Install
-----------------------

As of Geeklog 1.3 you now have option of installing Geeklog manually OR using the
installation script. NOTE: you may be forced to use the manual installation method 
depending on your hosting situation.  If you run the automated installation steps
and the script says the write test failed then you will need to follow the manual
instructions.

To Upgrade
-----------
Upgrading is no different than a fresh installation except your database already exists.  
First, back-up any files with custom code in them.  Then remove your current geeklog directory.  
After that just uncompress the new version and copy the resulting directory to the name of your
older geeklog version.  Then you need to change into /path/to/geeklog/sql/updates and apply all
needed database updates.  For example, if you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.1 you will need to 
apply 1.1_to_1.2.sql and 1.2_to_1.2.2.sql which will upgrade your database to Geeklog 1.2.5-1.
I say 1.2.5-1 because there were no database changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.5-1 (e.g. a 1.2.2 database 
is the same as a 1.2.5-1 database).  Then it's just a matter of following the steps below to upgrade
your system and database to the latest version

Using the automated installation script (preferred)
----------------------------------------------------
1) BACK-UP your database and, if upgrading, your current Geeklog installation
2) Unpack the tarball *within* your web tree
3) For *nix installations do a chown -R <webuser>:<webuser> /path/to/geeklog
4) For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and to the following:
    - chmod -R 777 logs/
    - chmod -R 777 public_html/backend/
5) Create the database you want Geeklog to reside in
6) Open a browser and navigate to http://<your_geeklog_url>/admin/install/install.php
7) Follow the instructions in the script

Manual installations
--------------------
1) First unpack the tarball within your web tree
2) For *nix installations do a chown -R <webuser>:<webuser> /path/to/geeklog
3) For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and to the following:
    - chmod -R 777 logs/
    - chmod -R 777 public_html/backend/
4) Copy /path/to/geeklog/config.default to /path/to/geeklog/config.php
5) Uncomment the line "$_CONF['path'] = '/path/to/geeklog/'"
6) Edit config.php as needed
7) Copy /path/to/geeklog/system/lib-database.sample to /path/to/geeklog/system/lib-database.php
8) Edit lib-database.php with your database settings
9) Copy /path/to/geeklog/public_html/lib-common.sample to /path/to/geeklog/public_html/lib-common.php
10) edit lib-common.php and change the path to config.php to point to the right location
11) Create the database you want Geeklog to reside in
12) Now point your browser to http://<your_geeklog_domain>/admin/install/install.php
12a) For fresh installations:
    - select the "New Database Only" option from the installation type drop down
    - enter the path to your base geeklog directory (where config.php resides)
    - Hit the "Next" button 
12b) For upgrades:
    - select the "Upgrade Database Only" option from teh installation type drop down  
    - enter the path to your base geeklog directory (where config.php resides)
    - Hit the "Next" button 
13) that's it!
