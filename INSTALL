Pre-Installation Steps
-----------------------

Take extreme care to back-up any files from your current Geeklog version that
have any custom code in them and, especially, lib-custom.php (where all custom
code should reside).  Also, if you are upgrading, please be sure to back up
your database.  I can't stress the importance of backing up your files and
database enough.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Installation
-------------

IMPORTANT:  The installation process for 1.3.5 has changed.  Please read this
section in its entirety!

As of 1.3.5, we have reverted back to a manual setup for Geeklog server
configurations but we still use the installation script to create database
structures or apply updates:
1) BACK-UP your database any customized Geeklog files if needed. 
2) Unpack the tarball *within* your web tree
3) For *nix installations do a chown -R <webuser>:<webuser> /path/to/geeklog
4) For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and to the following:
    - chmod -R 775 logs/
    - chmod -R 775 public_html/backend/
   Note: If you're doing the chmod via an ftp client, be sure to apply the
         chmod to the files in those directories as well!
5) Create the database you want Geeklog to reside in
6) edit config.php with your appropriate settings.  Windows users, you can use
   the unix '/' in your paths just fine.  Otherwise you'll need to use doubled
   Windows slashes '\\'.  Please note that the database settings are back in
   config.php.  This is to make it so that you do not have to edit
   lib-database.php
7) edit lib-common.php and change the require_once() at the top to point to the
   location of your config.php file.
8) open your browser and navigate to
      http://yourgeeklogdomain/admin/install/install.php
   and follow the directions!

Note on Upgrades
-----------------
Upgrading is no different than a fresh installation except your database
already exists.  First, back-up any files with custom code in them and back-up
your database.  Then remove your current geeklog directory.  After that just
uncompress the new version and copy the resulting directory to the name of your
older geeklog version.

Then you need to change into /path/to/geeklog/sql/updates and apply all needed
database updates.  For example, if you are upgrading from Geeklog 1.1 you will
need to apply 1.1_to_1.2.sql and 1.2_to_1.2.2.sql which will upgrade your
database to Geeklog 1.2.5-1. I say 1.2.5-1 because there were no database
changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.5-1 (e.g. a 1.2.2 database is the same as a 1.2.5-1
database).  Then it's just a matter of following the steps in the 'INSTALLATION'
section above to upgrade your system and database to the latest version

Common problems
---------------
The most common causes for problems during install or with the new site are:

1) Incorrect paths
   Please double-check your paths. Specifically, the one in lib-common.php,
   $_CONF['path'] and $_CONF['path_html'] as well as $_CONF['site_url'] from
   config.php.

2) Incorrect chmod
   Please make sure that you did the chmod commands as explained above for
   both the directories AND the files in those directories.

3) register_globals=off
   Geeklog requires that you have register_globals=on in your php.ini.
   However, since PHP 4.2.0, the default is "off".

If you still have problems, please go to <http://geeklog.sf.net/>. Consult the
FAQ there (under "Support") or use the search function on the site (e.g. if
get an error, search for the error message). Someone else probably had the same
problem before.
