Pre-Installation Steps
-----------------------

Take extreme care to back-up any files from your current Geeklog version that has any custom code in them
and, especially, lib-custom.php (where all custom code should reside).  Also, if you are upgrading, please
be sure to back up your database.  I can't stress the importance of backing up your files and database 
enough.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Installation
-------------

IMPORTANT:  The installation process for 1.3.5 has changed.  Please read this section in its entirety!

As of 1.3.5, we have reverted back to a manual setup for Geeklog server configurations but we still use
the installation script to create database structures or apply updates:
1) BACK-UP your database any customized Geeklog files if needed. 
2) Unpack the tarball *within* your web tree
3) For *nix installations do a chown -R <webuser>:<webuser> /path/to/geeklog
4) For *nix installations cd into /path/to/geeklog and to the following:
    - chmod -R 775 logs/
    - chmod -R 775 public_html/backend/
5) Create the database you want Geeklog to reside in
6) edit config.php with your appropriate settings.  Windows users, you can use the unix '/' in your paths
   just fine.  Otherwise you'll need to use doubled windows slashes '\\'.  Please note that the database
   settings are back in config.php.  This is to make it so that you do not have to edit lib-database.php
7) edit lib-common.php and change the include() at the top to point to the location of your config.php file.
8) open your browser and navigate to http://yourgeeklogdomain/admin/install/install.php and follow the directions!

Note on Upgrades
-----------------
Upgrading is no different than a fresh installation except your database already exists.  
First, back-up any files with custom code in them and back-up your database.  Then remove your 
current geeklog directory.  After that just uncompress the new version and copy the resulting 
directory to the name of your older geeklog version.  Then you need to change into 
/path/to/geeklog/sql/updates and apply all needed database updates.  For example, if you are 
upgrading from Geeklog 1.1 you will need to apply 1.1_to_1.2.sql and 1.2_to_1.2.2.sql which will 
upgrade your database to Geeklog 1.2.5-1. I say 1.2.5-1 because there were no database changes from 
1.2.2 to 1.2.5-1 (e.g. a 1.2.2 database is the same as a 1.2.5-1 database).  Then it's just a matter 
of following the steps in the 'INSTALLATION' sectoin to upgrade your system and database to the latest version
