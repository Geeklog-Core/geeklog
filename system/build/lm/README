lm.php v1.0.6

This script merges a Geeklog (foreign) language file with the english.php
language file, so that new strings added to english.php are automatically added
to the other language file.

The result is a fully working language file (no more missing texts), only that
some texts will appear in English. This will also make it easier for
translators since they will only have to translate the newly added strings.

Usage:

    php lm.php langfile.php [module] > new-langfile.php

Where "module" is the name of the plugin to update (or empty for a Core
language file).

If the filename of the language file contains 'utf-8', lm.php assumes it to
be in UTF-8 encoding. It then requires a PHP version with multi-byte string
support built in (--enable-mbstring option).

This script, while written in PHP, is supposed to be run from the command
line and thus requires the CLI version of PHP to be installed on your
computer. It also displays the merged language file on the screen, so you
should redirect the output to a new file. It also expects to find the
english.php language file in the current directory.

What it can do:

- add new individual strings and string arrays to the language file
- do some pretty printing
- remove obsoleted strings
- update plugin language files

What it can not do:

- detect changed strings

For changes in existing strings, it is recommended that you subscribe to
the geeklog-translations mailing list, where such information will be posted
when a new version of Geeklog is about to be released.
