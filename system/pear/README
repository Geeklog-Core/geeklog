This directory contains the PEAR packages that are needed by Geeklog. If you
don't have PEAR installed on your webserver, simply set the "Have Pear?" option
in the configutation to "False" and Geeklog will pick up the PEAR packages from
here.

Currently, Geeklog uses the following PEAR packages:

- PEAR
- Archive_Tar
- Archive_Zip
- Date
- HTTP_Request
- Mail
- Net_SMTP
- Net_Socket
- Net_URL
- Text_Wiki
- XML_RPC

The Console package is included as it is used by the base PEAR package (e.g.
when you try to update PEAR) but is not used by Geeklog itself.
