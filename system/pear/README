This directory contains the PEAR packages that are needed by Geeklog. If you
don't have PEAR installed on your webserver, simply set

     $_CONF['have_pear'] = false;

in config.php and Geeklog will pick up the PEAR packages from here.

Currently, Geeklog uses the following PEAR packages:

- PEAR
- HTTP_Request
- Mail
- Net_SMTP
- Net_Socket
- Net_URL
