This directory contains the PEAR packages that are needed by Geeklog. If you
don't have PEAR installed on your webserver, simply set

     $_CONF['have_pear'] = false;

in config.php and Geeklog will pick up the PEAR packages from here.

Currently, Geeklog uses the following PEAR packages:

- PEAR
- HTTP_Request
- Mail
- Net_SMTP
- Net_Socket
- Net_URL
- PHP_Compat
- XML_RPC

The Archive and Console packages are included as they are used by the base PEAR
package (e.g. when you try to update PEAR) but are not used by Geeklog itself.
