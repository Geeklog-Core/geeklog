Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog SpamX plugin.

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  

Step 2: Uncompress the SpamX plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called spamx in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html directory (usually public_html) 
create a directory called spamx.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called spamx.

Step 4:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/spamx/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory 
to the admin/plugins/spamx/ directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/spamx/ directory your created in step 3.

Step 5: Make the files spamx_action.php, spamx_examine.php, blacklist.php and mtblacklist.php in the 
public_html/spamx directory writable by you webserver.  Either chmod 766 or preferably chown the files 
to the user the webserver runs under eg nobody or apache.  If you do not do this you will not be able 
to use the admin interface.

Step 6:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/SpamX/ directory 
or run the plugin app in the admin interface and install from there. The install page will tell you if the 
install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog for possible problems.

Step 7: The final thing you must do is edit your comment.php (in public_html directory) and change the 
function savecomment name to savecomment1.  The SpamX plugin should now be installed and functioning.  
Clicking on the SpamX Icon will take you to the admin page.  

Step 7: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to SpamX administration.  
You can delegate control for admin through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/SpamX directory.  This will remove all the data from
your database.

Step 2: Rename savecomment1 in comment.php back to savecomment.

Step 3:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/SpamX/ 
<public_html>/SpamX/ and <admin>/plugins/SpamX/

Thats it.
