-------
This Static Page Geeklog Plug-in is the source code and database that is used to 
for creating semi-static pages in Geeklog quickly.  Like Geeklog this 
has is released under the GNU General Public License. It is a bona fide Open 
Source / Free Software project. 

The Static Page Geeklog Plugin-in is managed by Tony Bibbs
Like all good open source projects, Geeklog and this plug-in both depend on the 
community. Thanks for your continued support, and let us know what we can 
do to make Geeklog and the Static Page Plug-in even better.

The Static Page GeekLog Plug-in features the following:

- Runs on Geeklog version 1.3.4
- 100% database driven
- Automatically displays the last time a pages was updated after changes (unless blank page option is used).
- Let's you pick if the left or right blocks (or both) show up on a static page or, if you prefer, you can create an
  HTML page from scratch
- Uses the Geeklog security model to control who can edit a page
- Automatically generates the URL for pages for easy pasting into a template or
  or HTML file
- Great for creating security policies, about us pages and other static content.

HOW TO HELP
-----------
If you would like to help make the Static Pages Geeklog Plug-in even better 
please feel free to contribute bug fixes and submit enhancement requests
to the Geeklog website.  This is the first release and it has a long way
before it is 'polished' and I realize that.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
May want to enhance the security so that each page is assigned an owner/group and 
associated permissions just like Geeklog stories/blocks/etc do it.  I am speaking from
the user's perspective, NOT the admin's perspective.  Administrative security already
uses the Geeklog security model.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
------------------------------------
You must install this plugin-in with a version of Geeklog version 1.3.4. You can get this
plugin to work with Geeklog 1.3 through 1.3.3 by downloading the latest admin/plugins.php and
getting the update templates for layout/<theme_name/admin/plugins/pluginlist.thtml. This is gauranted
not to work with any version prior to Geeklog 1.3.

To install:
1) Download the tarball and put it in /path/to/geeklog/plugins
2) uncompress the tarball
3) Change into the newly created staticpages directory
4) Move the staticpages/admin directory to /path/to/geeklog/public_html/admin/plugins/staticpages/
   NOTE: you must use that directory name
5) Move the staticpages/public_html directory to /path/to/geeklog/public_html/staticpages/
   NOTE: you must use that directory name
6) In your browser, go to http://your_geeklog_url/admin/plugins/staticpages/install.php
7) You should get a message that your the datastructures have been created
8) That's it!

UNINSTALLING
------------
1) Execute this in your database client:
        ALTER TABLE <vars_table> SET value = '0' WHERE name = 'staticpages'
   Be sure to substitute <vars_table> with the name of your Geeklog vars table
2) In your browser, navigate to http://your_geeklog_url/admin/plugins/staticpages/install.php
3) You should get a message saying the data structure were successfully removed.
4) Remove the following directories:
         /path/to/geeklog/plugins/staticpages/
         /path/to/geeklog/public_html/staticpages/
         /path/to/geeklog/public_html/admin/plugins/staticpages/
5) that's it!

SECURITY ISSUES
---------------
It is up to you to properly secure your database, web server and host
settings.  If you are looking for information in securing your system
some starting points I can recommend are:
