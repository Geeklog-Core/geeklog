Static Pages Geeklog Plugin 0.1.0
---------------------------------

1) Integrate a bb-code style system as opposed to using HTML.
2) May want to make this part of the core GL code-base and have it so that users can have a personal page...something like http://www.example.com/userpage.php?uid=1
3) May want to implement the same security on each individual page as you would for stories, links, etc.
3) Anything else?  Email suggestions on how this plugin could be made better to Tony Bibbs at tony@tonybibbs.com
