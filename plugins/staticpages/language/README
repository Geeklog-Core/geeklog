This directory contains the language files for the Static Pages plugin. The
plugin will pick the appropriate language file automatically based on the
language settings in your user settings or the default language in config.php.

IMPORTANT: If there is no language file for your language, then the plugin
will not work. In that case, simply copy one of the existing language files
and give it the same name as the language file you're using in
/path/to/geeklog/language. So e.g. if your language setting is 'dutch', you
need to have a file 'dutch.php' in this directory. If there is none, you
could make a copy of 'english.php' and name that copy 'dutch.php'.
