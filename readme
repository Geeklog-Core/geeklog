1) What is Geeklog?
================
Geeklog is a PHP/MySQL based application for managing dynamic web content.

"Out of the box", it is a blog engine, or a CMS with support for comments,
trackbacks, multiple syndication formats, spam protection, and all the other
vital features of such a system.

The core Geeklog distribution can easily be extended by the many community
developed plugins to radically alter its functionality. Available plugins
include forums, image galleries, and many more.

Geeklog was originally used to run SecurityGeeks and NewsGeeks, and has since
been released under the GNU General Public License. It is a bona fide Open
Source / Free Software project. The original template code Geeklog uses is 
from PHPLib, however, which was under the LGPL.

Geeklog was originally created by Jason Whittenburg in 2001, but like all 
good open source projects, depends on the community. After Jason, others have 
stepped up like Tony Bibbs and Dirk Haun, in the role of project 
leader for Geeklog.

Thanks for your continued support, and let us know what we can do to make 
Geeklog better.

3) Support
==========

3.1) Website
==================
The Geeklog website is a good source of information at:

https://www.geeklog.net

Where you can find the Geeklog FAQ, Wiki, and the Forums.

3.2) Online Chat
==================
Another option for support is visiting the Geeklog Gitter room found at:

https://gitter.im/Geeklog-Core/geeklog

Here you can ask questions of the developers and other people interested in 
Geeklog.

3.3) Mailing Lists
==================
Another good support channel is the mailing list located at:

http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-users


3.3) Known Issues
=================
All known issues are tracked in our bug tracker. If you identify a bug please
let us know by filling out a bug report at:

https://github.com/Geeklog-Core/geeklog/issues


4) System Requirements and Installation
=======================================
See public_html/docs/english/install.html or the Geeklog.net site:

https://www.geeklog.net/docs/english/install.html


5) Security Issues
==================
Geeklog is a security focused CMS. We have focused on making the code secure
and the application secure, and have been rewarded with a comparatively low
level of exploits having been identified and published by third parties.

We have provided a set of API's and coding guidelines to ensure third party
plugin developers do not compromise the security of a Geeklog installation,
however, we can not guarantee that our work or theirs is secure.

It is up to you to properly secure your database, web server and host
settings.  If you are looking for information in securing your system
some starting points we can recommend are:

https://www.php.net
https://www.mysql.com
https://www.apache.org
https://www.devshed.com
http://www.securityfocus.com
https://www.linux.com


6) License
==========
Geeklog is licensed under the GPL. There should be an included LICENSE file - if
it really interests you (or you having trouble sleeping) go ahead and read it.

In a nice gesture you could provide a link back to us:

https://www.geeklog.net

There is also a button that is in the release that we would appreciate you use
(in public_html/images/buttons).
