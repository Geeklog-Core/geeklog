1) What is Geeklog?
================
Geeklog is a PHP/MySQL based application for managing dynamic web content.

"Out of the box", it is a blog engine, or a CMS with support for comments,
trackbacks, multiple syndication formats, spam protection, and all the other
vital features of such a system.

The core Geeklog distribution can easily be extended by the many community
developed plugins to radically alter its functionality. Available plugins
include forums, image galleries, and many more.

Geeklog was originally used to run SecurityGeeks and NewsGeeks, and has since
been released under the GNU General Public License. It is a bona fide Open
Source / Free Software project. The template code Geeklog uses is from 
PHPLib, however, which is under the LGPL.

Geeklog was originally created by Jason Whittenburg, but like all good open
source projects, depends on the community. Geeklog 1.5 is currently maintained
by Dirk Haun whilst Tony bibbs focusses on Geeklog 2. Thanks for your continued
support, and let us know what we can do to make Geeklog better. 

For the installation instructions please see public_html/docs/install.html

3) Support
==========

3.1) Mailing Lists
==================
The best support channel is a mailing list located at:

http://lists.geeklog.net/mailman/listinfo/geeklog-users

Additionally the Geeklog home page is a good source of information at:

http://www.geeklog.net

3.2) IRC Channel
================
There is also a IRC channel, where we have live Geeklog chat.  Once you have
an IRC client such as mIRC (www.mirc.co.uk), or BitchX the you can log on:

Server: irc.freenode.net
Channel: #Geeklog


3.3) Known Issues
=================
All known issues are tracked in our bug tracker. If you identify a bug please
let us know by filling out a bug report at:

http://project.geeklog.net/tracker/?group_id=6&atid=105

4) System Requirements and Installation
=======================================
See public_html/docs/install.html or the Geeklog.net site:
http://www.geeklog.net/docs/install.html

5) Security Issues
==================
Geeklog is a security focussed CMS. We have focussed on making the code secure
and the application secure, and have been rewarded with a comparatively low
level of exploits having been identified and published by third parties.

We have provided a set of API's and coding guidlines to ensure third party
plugin developers do not compromise the security of a Geeklog installation,
however, we can not garentee that our work or theirs is secure.

It is up to you to properly secure your database, web server and host 
settings.  If you are looking for information in securing your system
some starting points we can recommend are:

http://www.php.net
http://www.mysql.com
http://www.apache.org
http://www.devshed.com
http://www.securityfocus.com
http://www.linux.com


6) License
==========
Geeklog is licensed under the GPL. There should be an included LICENSE file - if
it really interests you (or you having trouble sleeping) go ahead and read it.

In a nice gesture you could provide a link back to us:

http://www.geeklog.net

There is also a button that is in the release that we would appreciate you use
(in public_html/images/buttons).
