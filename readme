WELCOME
-------
Geeklog is the source code and database that was originally used to run 
SecurityGeeks and NewsGeeks, and has since been released under the GNU General 
Public License. It is a bona fide Open Source / Free Software project. Use 
this site to get the GeekLog source, read the latest GeekLog news, and 
participate in Geeklog discussions.  The template code Geeklog uses is from 
PHPLib, however, which is under the LGPL.

GeekLog is run by Tony Bibbs, but like all good open source projects,
depends on the community. Thanks for your continued support, and let us know
what we can do to make GeekLog better.
